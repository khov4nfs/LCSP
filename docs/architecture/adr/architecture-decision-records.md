# LCSP Architecture Decision Records

## Purpose

This document is the active ADR authority index for the A-to-Z runnable MVP. Detailed decisions live in individual ADR files. Historical reasoning remains in git history, not active implementation or UX authority.

## Current Architecture Direction

```text
Modular NestJS API synchronous control plane
+ Python Worker Platform for all asynchronous domain workloads
+ native Deep Agents / LangGraph repository analysis
+ PostgreSQL/Prisma for primary persistence
+ ChromaDB structure-first vectorless legal retrieval
+ RabbitMQ/outbox
+ S3-compatible object storage
+ real LLM provider for A-to-Z acceptance; embeddings are not required for legal retrieval MVP
```

The system uses deterministic orchestration, state machines, evidence gates, and bounded workers. It does not use free-form autonomous agents to bypass domain rules.

## Status Legend

| Status                 | Meaning                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accepted               | Active MVP constraint                                    |
| Accepted — Superseding | Active decision that replaces part/all of an earlier ADR |
| Partially Superseded   | Retained only for portions not replaced by a newer ADR   |
| Deferred               | Not active MVP authority                                 |
| Historical             | Evidence only; not implementation authority              |

## Authority and Supersession Rules

1. Newer explicit supersession notes override older conflicting wording.
2. Repository-analysis ownership is governed by `docs/architecture/repository-deep-agent-analysis.md`; older scanner lifecycle decisions are superseded.
3. ADR-024 overrides mock-LLM-as-default happy-path wording.
4. ADR-025 overrides local JSONL corpus seed as the legal source architecture.
5. ADR-026 overrides pgvector, embedding-index, hybrid-vector and unspecified legal retrieval wording for MVP.
6. Product scope and canonical requirements remain governed by PRD, FR/NFR catalogs, and Project Owner decisions propagated into active docs.
7. Phase 5.2L supersedes older wording: RBAC replaces RBAC, structured attestation is removed from active MVP, `FR-050` is Automatic Trusted Scan Initiation, `FR-051` is removed from product scope, and Node.js downstream workers are superseded.

## Clarified ADR-002 Runtime Boundary

The active decision is:

```text
NestJS API handles synchronous HTTP, RBAC enforcement boundary, job/trigger creation, and query surfaces.
Python Worker Platform owns all asynchronous domain workloads.
Managed Repository Analysis Agent owns repository evidence derivation inside the assessment MDA sandbox.
Codebase Memory MCP is optional structural memory; direct repository source is authoritative.
```

Any older statement that the controlled MVP scanner worker is TypeScript-first is historical and superseded.

## Clarified ADR-003 / ADR-008 Collaboration Boundary

- Manager is required and sufficient for the active MVP golden path.
- Developer invitation/task workspace is retired from the active MVP.
- Structured attestation under `FR-045/FR-046` is `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`.
- Reintroduction requires a new scope decision and cross-layer contract.
- Delegated free-form technical clarification under `FR-052` is Deferred and must not become an active UX route.

## Legal Operations UX Boundary

ADR-025 corpus source validation, review, approval, and index-build actions are performed by an Internal Legal Operator through internal API/CLI for MVP. They are not Manager customer-facing UX scope. A dedicated legal-operations web console requires a future scope decision.

## Locked Technical Profiles

### Repository Analysis

The active repository-analysis profile is defined by
docs/architecture/repository-deep-agent-analysis.md. Older scanner-runtime ADr details are
available through Git history only and are not active implementation authority.


### Authorization

```text
RBAC source of truth
roles as subject attributes/templates only
deny-by-default
tenant-scoped
server-side enforced
versioned/auditable decisions
engine/storage/cache/invalidation/topology/failure behavior: resolved by docs/implementation/decisions/rbac-runtime-decision.md
```

### LLM

```text
provider mode required for integrated/A-to-Z acceptance
mock mode limited to unit tests, offline CI, credential-unavailable component development
sanitized structured inputs only
schema validation + timeout/retry + audit + budget controls
```

### Legal Retrieval

```text
validated official-source snapshots
approved immutable LegalCorpusVersion
ChromaDB structure-first vectorless legal index
Clause-level base retrieval unit
metadata and full-text candidate retrieval
direct chunk/article lookup
one-hop cross-reference expansion
parent-context assembly
corpus/effective-date/source/metadata filters
citation reconstruction and retrieval audit
retrieved citation allowlist validation
```

## Non-Claims

- This index does not authorize implementation or production deployment.
- It does not certify legal reliability or compliance.
- It does not replace individual ADR detail where no conflict exists.
- Current planning status remains UX pending and story traceability pending.
