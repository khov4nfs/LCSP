## Research Overview

Research này xác định bộ template implementation task và engineering handoff phù hợp cho LCSP dựa trên tài liệu active của dự án và nguồn kỹ thuật hiện hành. Phạm vi bao gồm technology stack, integration patterns, architecture patterns, implementation adoption, workflow, vận hành, risk, traceability và yêu cầu handoff cho engineer/AI agent.

Kết luận chính: LCSP cần tài liệu task-level có contract rõ, không chỉ backlog/story mô tả ý định. Template phải khóa source authority, runtime owner, boundary thay đổi, API/event/queue/data/authz/audit contracts, verification intent, rollback và open decisions. Phần Research Synthesis cuối tài liệu gom các phát hiện này thành khuyến nghị triển khai cụ thể cho `docs/implementation/templates/`, `docs/implementation/tasks/`, `docs/implementation/handoffs/` và `docs/implementation/runbooks/`.

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Programming Languages

LCSP handoff templates should assume a polyglot implementation stack rather than a single-language backlog. The active implementation docs split the synchronous API boundary into NestJS/TypeScript and the asynchronous domain workloads into a Python Worker Platform. This means each implementation task must identify both the owning runtime and the cross-runtime handoff contract.

For LCSP, the primary language categories are:

- TypeScript for API contracts, NestJS modules, Prisma-facing persistence, request validation, RBAC enforcement boundaries, route handlers, outbox writes, and status/read-model APIs.
- Python for scan-trigger resolution, repository-analysis runtime, TechnicalProfile, AIUsageFlow, reconciliation, legal ingestion/index/matching, classification, gap analysis, and document workers.
- JavaScript/TypeScript subprocess analysis for repository scanning, especially `ts-morph`, Knip, and package/ecosystem evidence extraction.
- SQL/schema language for PostgreSQL/Prisma migrations and persistence contracts.
- Markdown/YAML for task specs, handoffs, decision records, issue templates, and queue/event contract references.

The 12-Factor App methodology is relevant to LCSP task handoffs because it explicitly targets service-style applications with declarative setup, portability across environments, reduced dev/prod divergence, explicit dependencies, environment-based config, attached backing services, strict build/release/run separation, logs as streams, and one-off admin processes. These ideas map directly to LCSP's service split: NestJS API, Python workers, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, ChromaDB, object storage, and LLM provider configuration. Source: https://12factor.net/

For task templates, every task should therefore declare:

- runtime owner: `nestjs-api`, `deepagents`, `scanner-subprocess`, `migration`, `documentation`;
- language/toolchain: TypeScript/NestJS/Prisma or Python worker module;
- config and secret refs, never inline secrets;
- build/release/run expectations;
- backing services required.

_Popular Languages:_ TypeScript and Python are the active LCSP implementation languages.
_Emerging Languages:_ Not applicable for MVP; adding Go/Rust/etc. would be a new technical decision.
_Language Evolution:_ LCSP should keep Python as async-domain owner and TypeScript as API owner to avoid reintroducing the old Node worker ambiguity.
_Performance Characteristics:_ TypeScript API is best for request validation/state handoff; Python workers are better aligned to scanner/legal/LLM workloads and Python analysis libraries.
_Sources:_ https://12factor.net/, `docs/implementation/backend-implementation.md`, `docs/implementation/python-worker-platform-implementation.md`

### Development Frameworks and Libraries

The implementation-task template should not simply say "implement story". It should force each task to name the framework boundary and the artifact contract it changes.

Relevant framework/documentation patterns:

- GitLab description templates standardize issue, task, incident, and merge request descriptions; GitLab documents that these templates create consistent layouts, support workflow-stage specialization, custom templates at project/group/instance levels, and can auto-populate fields. This supports creating LCSP task templates with stable sections rather than free-form notes. Source: https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/description_templates/
- Atlassian's user-story guidance emphasizes definition of done, subtasks/owners, personas, ordered steps, feedback, and making stories small enough for one sprint. LCSP should adapt this at task level by making every implementation task trace to a story/AC/NFR and by breaking task scopes that span multiple build waves. Source: https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories
- arc42 is explicitly a template for architecture communication and documentation, including introduction/goals, constraints, context/scope, solution strategy, building block view, runtime view, deployment view, crosscutting concepts, architectural decisions, quality requirements, risks/technical debt, and glossary. LCSP handoff docs should borrow this structure selectively, not reproduce it wholesale in every task. Source: https://arc42.org/overview
- C4 provides developer-friendly architecture diagrams using hierarchical abstractions and diagrams for software systems, containers, components, code, plus supporting dynamic/deployment diagrams. LCSP task handoffs should use C4-style references when a task changes service/module boundaries or runtime flow. Source: https://c4model.com/

For LCSP, task templates should have three levels:

1. **Implementation Task Brief**: one ticket/task, scoped to one owner and one deliverable.
2. **Engineering Handoff Guide**: wave/domain-level context packet for a group of related tasks.
3. **Runbook/Operational Checklist**: only for tasks that add deployable services, queues, storage, providers, or recovery behavior.

_Major Frameworks:_ NestJS, Prisma, Python worker platform, RabbitMQ/outbox, ChromaDB, object storage, LLM Gateway.
_Micro-frameworks:_ Task-level Markdown templates, GitLab/GitHub-style issue templates, ADR records, runbook snippets.
_Evolution Trends:_ Structured templates are preferred over ad hoc handoff because LCSP has compliance, audit, and traceability requirements.
_Ecosystem Maturity:_ arc42/C4/12-Factor/GitLab/Atlassian patterns are mature enough to use as template foundations.
_Sources:_ https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/description_templates/, https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories, https://arc42.org/overview, https://c4model.com/

### Database and Storage Technologies

LCSP implementation tasks must distinguish between persistence, queueing, indexing, object storage, and audit history. A generic "DB changes" section is not enough.

Active LCSP storage categories:

- PostgreSQL/Prisma for domain entities, workflow state, audit/outbox records, idempotency keys, artifact metadata, policy state, and versioned run references.
- RabbitMQ for command/event transport, with an outbox publisher and DLQ/retry behavior.
- ChromaDB for structure-first vectorless legal retrieval index, legal records, stable IDs, metadata filtering, full-text/direct lookup, xref context, and citation allowlist support.
- S3-compatible object storage for source snapshots, legal source snapshots, generated artifacts, and large immutable evidence references.
- Logs/audit streams as operational evidence, with redaction and correlation IDs.

The 12-Factor App's "backing services" principle is useful here because it treats databases, queues, caches, and external services as attached resources rather than hidden local assumptions. LCSP task handoffs should list all backing services required by the task, the local/dev substitute if any, and the failure behavior when unavailable. Source: https://12factor.net/

_Relational Databases:_ PostgreSQL through Prisma remains the canonical metadata/state persistence path.
_NoSQL Databases:_ ChromaDB is used as the legal retrieval index, not as a general document DB.
_In-Memory Databases:_ None canonical for MVP; Redis/cache usage would need explicit ADR/task dependency.
_Data Warehousing:_ Not active MVP scope.
_Source:_ https://12factor.net/, `docs/implementation/persistence-implementation.md`, `docs/implementation/chromadb-vectorless-legal-retriever-implementation.md`

### Development Tools and Platforms

LCSP's task and handoff templates should support both human engineers and AI coding agents. That means each task needs unambiguous inputs, touched docs, implementation files, commands/events, verification expectations, and non-goals.

Recommended task-template fields:

- `Task ID`, `Wave`, `Owner`, `Runtime`, `Status`
- `Purpose`
- `Inputs`
- `Outputs`
- `Scope`
- `Non-Goals`
- `Dependencies`
- `Traceability`: UC, FR, AC, NFR, story, UX state, domain state
- `Contracts Changed`: API routes, command/event, schema/entity, queue, artifact, audit
- `Implementation Steps`
- `Failure/Recovery Behavior`
- `Security/Privacy/Audit Requirements`
- `Verification`
- `Definition of Done`
- `Rollback/Backout`
- `Open Decisions`

GitLab's template docs support the general idea of storing reusable Markdown templates in-repo so issue/task/MR descriptions become consistent and workflow-specific. LCSP can implement the same concept in `docs/implementation/templates/` even if the repo is GitHub-hosted, because the core value is structured handoff, not a specific platform feature. Source: https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/description_templates/

Atlassian's guidance that stories should include definition of done, subtasks/owners, ordered steps, and sizing small enough for a sprint maps directly to LCSP's task discipline. A task that spans multiple LCSP waves should be split. Source: https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories

_IDE and Editors:_ Not prescribed; templates should be editor-neutral.
_Version Control:_ Markdown task docs and implementation handoffs should be committed with the same PR as planning artifacts.
_Build Systems:_ To be declared per runtime once framework scaffolding exists.
_Testing Frameworks:_ Temporarily deferred per owner direction, but every task should still include a verification section with manual/doc/contract checks.
_Sources:_ https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/description_templates/, https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories

### Cloud Infrastructure and Deployment

The handoff template must identify whether a task is:

- pure documentation/planning;
- local runnable framework setup;
- API runtime change;
- Python worker runtime change;
- queue/outbox/persistence migration;
- legal index/storage/provider integration;
- operational hardening.

For deployable tasks, the template should borrow from 12-Factor and SRE playbook practices:

- config comes from environment/config refs;
- backing services are declared;
- logs/audit/correlation IDs are part of the handoff;
- startup/shutdown and retry behavior are documented;
- operational response has a playbook entry when new alerts/failure states are introduced.

Google's SRE Workbook describes playbooks as high-level instructions for responding to automated alerts, including severity/impact, debugging suggestions, and possible mitigation or resolution actions. It also notes that alert/playbook entries can reduce stress, MTTR, and human error. LCSP should apply this to worker failures, DLQ saturation, cleanup failures, provider outage, invalid schema, missing citation, and document guardrail violations. Source: https://sre.google/workbook/on-call/

_Major Cloud Providers:_ Not decided in active MVP docs; task docs should avoid assuming AWS/GCP/Azure unless a deployment decision is made.
_Container Technologies:_ Likely relevant for API/worker separation but not yet a task template assumption.
_Serverless Platforms:_ Not active canonical path.
_CDN and Edge Computing:_ Not active MVP scope.
_Sources:_ https://12factor.net/, https://sre.google/workbook/on-call/

### Technology Adoption Trends

The research points to a practical pattern for LCSP: use lightweight, structured templates with explicit traceability rather than heavyweight one-size-fits-all architecture docs.

The best fit is a hybrid:

- Use **Atlassian-style story discipline** for user value, owners, ordered steps, and definition of done.
- Use **GitLab-style description templates** for consistent in-repo task and handoff structure.
- Use **arc42 sections** for domain/wave-level engineering handoff, especially constraints, context, runtime view, deployment view, crosscutting concepts, decisions, quality requirements, and risks.
- Use **C4 references** when a task changes API/worker/container/component relationships.
- Use **12-Factor constraints** for service/runtime/deployment tasks.
- Use **SRE playbook sections** when a task adds operational failure modes.

For LCSP specifically, this means the next docs should not just be a backlog. They should be a template-backed implementation packet:

```text
docs/implementation/templates/
  implementation-task-template.md
  engineering-handoff-template.md
  operational-runbook-template.md

docs/implementation/tasks/
  module-task-prisma-postgresql-baseline-and-chromadb-config.md
  module-task-config-secret-loader-and-provider-refs.md
  ...

docs/implementation/handoffs/
  wave-1-foundations-handoff.md
  wave-2-assessment-core-handoff.md
  ...
```

_Migration Patterns:_ Move from high-level implementation delivery plan into task-level packets with explicit contracts.
_Emerging Technologies:_ AI-assisted coding increases the need for stricter task inputs, non-goals, and verification because vague handoffs produce scope drift.
_Legacy Technology:_ Avoid reintroducing Node scanner worker, pgvector legal retrieval, RBAC authority, structured attestation, or manual evidence JSON.
_Community Trends:_ Repository-native Markdown templates are broadly supported and easy to review in PR.

## Integration Patterns Analysis

### API Design Patterns

LCSP task handoffs should treat APIs as resource/state contracts, not merely controller names. Google AIP-121 defines resource-oriented API design around individually named resources, their hierarchy/relationships, and a small set of standard methods, while allowing custom methods when standard methods do not fit. It also warns against making the public API identical to the database schema. This is directly relevant to LCSP because API routes must expose assessment, wizard, scan, classification, document, and audit resources without leaking persistence internals. Source: https://google.aip.dev/121

For LCSP, API task briefs should include:

- public/internal route group;
- resource model exposed to clients;
- request/response DTO;
- state transition guarded by the endpoint;
- idempotency key behavior for mutating operations;
- error response contract;
- RBAC decision point;
- audit event emitted;
- downstream command/outbox record, if any.

_RESTful APIs:_ Use resource-oriented routes for API-owned status/read/write boundaries, with custom action routes only for domain transitions such as conflict resolution or document generation requests.
_GraphQL APIs:_ Not recommended for MVP handoff templates because LCSP has state-machine, audit, and route-level RBAC requirements already represented as REST-style API contracts.
_RPC and gRPC:_ Not active MVP route style. Could be future internal service transport, but current docs use NestJS API plus RabbitMQ commands/events.
_Webhook Patterns:_ Trusted scan triggers should be documented as source-authenticated event ingress with mapping resolution, idempotency, blocked states, and audit, not as generic webhook handlers.
_Source:_ https://google.aip.dev/121, `docs/implementation/backend-implementation.md`

### Communication Protocols

LCSP uses a mixed synchronous/asynchronous integration model:

- HTTP/HTTPS for UI/API interactions, status polling, document download, audit export, and internal legal-corpus approval endpoints.
- RabbitMQ command/event transport for asynchronous domain workloads.
- Outbox-based publication between transactional persistence and RabbitMQ.
- API-owned status projection instead of direct Web-to-Worker communication.

RabbitMQ's work queue guidance highlights why acknowledgments matter: without ack behavior, a task can be lost when a worker dies; with acknowledgments, unprocessed work can be requeued. RabbitMQ also distinguishes queue/message durability from stronger persistence guarantees. LCSP task templates should force queue tasks to name ack behavior, durability, retry profile, DLQ, idempotency key, and terminal event rules. Source: https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python

CloudEvents is useful as a reference model for event envelope consistency. CloudEvents describes event data in a common way, aiming to reduce source-specific handling and improve portability/tooling across environments. LCSP already has canonical `command.*` and `event.*` names; the handoff template should still require CloudEvents-like metadata discipline: event type, source, id, time, subject/aggregate, correlation/causation IDs, schema version, and data refs only. Source: https://cloudevents.io/

_HTTP/HTTPS Protocols:_ Synchronous API boundary, status reads, internal legal operations, and artifact access.
_WebSocket Protocols:_ Not active MVP. Polling is the locked controlled-MVP progress strategy; SSE may be future.
_Message Queue Protocols:_ RabbitMQ/AMQP-like queue semantics are central for worker commands/events.
_gRPC and Protocol Buffers:_ Not active MVP; useful only if later ADR introduces internal RPC.
_Sources:_ https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python, https://cloudevents.io/

### Data Formats and Standards

LCSP task handoffs should use JSON/YAML/Markdown contracts carefully:

- JSON for API DTO examples, event payload examples, worker command envelopes, LLM structured output examples, and validation schemas.
- YAML or Markdown frontmatter for task metadata, status, traceability, input/output docs, owners, and dependencies.
- Markdown for implementation task docs, engineering handoffs, ADR notes, and runbooks.
- SQL/Prisma schema diffs for persistence tasks.
- ChromaDB metadata schemas for legal index tasks.
- Redacted artifact metadata references instead of raw source, secrets, or full prompts.

CloudEvents supports both a shared event model and language SDKs, but LCSP should not automatically adopt CloudEvents as an implementation dependency. The practical adoption is a normalized envelope discipline for command/event documentation. Source: https://cloudevents.io/

For security-sensitive API data, JWT is a compact claims representation that can be signed/integrity-protected and has registered claims such as issuer, subject, audience, expiration, not-before, issued-at, and JWT ID. LCSP should not expose auth internals in task docs, but auth-related tasks should require issuer/audience/expiry/session policy checks to be documented. Source: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519

_JSON and XML:_ JSON is the practical default for API/event examples; XML is not active LCSP scope.
_Protobuf and MessagePack:_ Not active MVP; avoid unless ADR introduces them.
_CSV and Flat Files:_ Not appropriate for canonical domain handoffs except export/report artifacts if explicitly required.
_Custom Data Formats:_ LCSP should define custom domain schemas only as versioned DTO/event/artifact contracts.
_Sources:_ https://cloudevents.io/, https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519

### System Interoperability Approaches

LCSP integration docs should distinguish synchronous control-plane actions from asynchronous domain work:

- API receives and validates user/system intent.
- API applies RBAC and state guards.
- API writes durable state, audit, and outbox.
- Outbox publisher emits a command.
- Python worker consumes exactly one command family.
- Worker writes domain output and outbox event.
- API/status projection exposes safe progress/result state.

Enterprise Integration Patterns remains useful vocabulary for LCSP task/handoff templates: message channel, point-to-point channel, publish-subscribe channel, dead letter channel, guaranteed delivery, message broker, message translator, content filter, idempotent receiver, competing consumers, and message history all map to LCSP queue/outbox/worker concerns. Source: https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/

_Point-to-Point Integration:_ API-to-worker commands should behave as point-to-point work dispatch for each worker queue.
_API Gateway Patterns:_ Not currently documented as a separate gateway; NestJS API is the boundary.
_Service Mesh:_ Not active MVP; do not assume.
_Enterprise Service Bus:_ Not active MVP; RabbitMQ with typed commands/events is sufficient.
_Source:_ https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/

### Microservices Integration Patterns

LCSP is service-split, but the current MVP is better described as an API plus Python Worker Platform than as independently versioned public microservices. Therefore the handoff template should emphasize boundaries, contracts, and state ownership rather than importing a full microservices platform stack.

Recommended LCSP microservice-style pattern usage:

- **API boundary pattern:** NestJS API owns synchronous validation, RBAC, state guard, audit, and job enqueue.
- **Worker command handler pattern:** each Python worker owns one command family, idempotency, terminal state, audit, and outbox event.
- **Outbox pattern:** domain state and outbox event are stored durably before publication.
- **Idempotent receiver pattern:** duplicate commands must resume/no-op rather than duplicate artifacts.
- **Claim-check pattern:** queue payloads carry safe references, not raw source, secrets, large artifacts, or full prompts.
- **State projection pattern:** UI reads API-owned status projections.

Google AIP-121's emphasis on standard methods, resource consistency, and stateless protocol supports LCSP API documentation. RabbitMQ's acknowledgement and durability guidance supports LCSP worker task documentation. Enterprise Integration Patterns supplies the vocabulary for failure/retry/DLQ/idempotency handoffs. Sources: https://google.aip.dev/121, https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python, https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/

_API Gateway Pattern:_ NestJS API acts as the controlled product/API boundary, but not a generic gateway.
_Service Discovery:_ Not active MVP.
_Circuit Breaker Pattern:_ Useful for LLM provider/object storage/ChromaDB calls, but should be task-specific.
_Saga Pattern:_ LCSP has a workflow chain, but should document explicit state machines and blocked states rather than call everything a saga.
_Sources:_ https://google.aip.dev/121, https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/

### Event-Driven Integration

LCSP's event-driven handoff is central. Every implementation task that touches async work should list:

- command name;
- event name;
- queue binding;
- producer;
- consumer;
- payload reference model;
- idempotency key;
- retry/DLQ behavior;
- terminal success event;
- terminal failure/blocked event;
- audit event;
- correlation ID propagation;
- downstream consumer dependency.

CloudEvents reinforces the need for common event description because inconsistent event formats force bespoke event handlers and reduce portability. LCSP does not need to fully adopt CloudEvents, but its documentation should require a common event envelope discipline for every command/event. Source: https://cloudevents.io/

RabbitMQ's work-queue guidance reinforces that workers should acknowledge only after processing is complete and that durability requires both durable queues and persistent messages. LCSP task docs should explicitly ask whether a worker can safely ack, retry, fail terminally, or DLQ. Source: https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python

_Publish-Subscribe Patterns:_ Used for domain facts after terminal transitions where multiple projections may consume.
_Event Sourcing:_ Not active MVP; audit/outbox/history are not the same as event-sourced state.
_Message Broker Patterns:_ RabbitMQ commands/events plus DLQ/retry/outbox are active.
_CQRS Patterns:_ Read/status projections are relevant, but full CQRS should not be overclaimed unless implemented.
_Sources:_ https://cloudevents.io/, https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python

### Integration Security Patterns

LCSP is authorization-heavy. Task templates must require security and privacy fields for every API/worker/data integration.

OWASP API Security Top 10 2023 highlights risks directly relevant to LCSP: broken object-level authorization, broken authentication, broken object property-level authorization, unrestricted resource consumption, broken function-level authorization, sensitive business-flow abuse, SSRF, security misconfiguration, improper inventory management, and unsafe consumption of APIs. LCSP task templates should translate these into concrete checks: tenant scoping, RBAC, DTO allowlists, rate/resource bounds, repository/source URL validation, route inventory, and third-party provider safety. Source: https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/

OAuth 2.0 is the baseline authorization framework for delegated authorization flows; JWT is a compact claims format used in many auth systems. LCSP docs already separate OAuth/OIDC identity from GitHub repository authorization. Task handoffs should preserve that separation and require explicit validation of issuer, audience, expiry, nonce/state where relevant, and RBAC as the final internal authorization authority. Sources: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749, https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519

_OAuth 2.0 and JWT:_ Relevant to identity/session tasks, but RBAC remains LCSP authorization authority.
_API Key Management:_ Applicable to provider refs, GitHub App integration, object storage, ChromaDB, RabbitMQ, and LLM Gateway config.
_Mutual TLS:_ Not active MVP unless deployment architecture adds it.
_Data Encryption:_ Required as a security concern, but task docs should reference concrete storage/transport decisions rather than vague encryption claims.
_Sources:_ https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/, https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749, https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519

### Integration Template Implications for LCSP

The LCSP implementation-task template should add a dedicated **Integration Contracts** section:

```text
API routes:
Command/event:
Queue/binding:
Producer:
Consumer:
Payload refs:
Idempotency key:
State transition:
Audit event:
Correlation/causation IDs:
Failure behavior:
Security checks:
Downstream dependency:
```

The engineering handoff template should add a domain-level **Interoperability Map**:

```text
User/API boundary
API/state/audit/outbox boundary
Queue/worker boundary
Worker/domain output boundary
Projection/status boundary
Document/artifact boundary
Operational recovery boundary
```

For LCSP, this is non-negotiable because most product value flows across boundaries: API to Python workers, scanner to TechnicalProfile, TechnicalProfile to AIUsageFlow, AIUsageFlow to reconciliation, VerifiedProfile to legal matching, LegalRuleMatch to classification, classification to gap analysis, gap analysis to document generation, and audit/export across all steps.

## Architectural Patterns and Design

### System Architecture Patterns

LCSP should be documented as a **web-queue-worker plus event-driven workflow architecture**, not as a pure microservices architecture and not as a monolith. Azure Architecture Center describes the Web-Queue-Worker style as a web front end that handles HTTP/user interactions and a worker that performs resource-intensive or long-running tasks through an asynchronous queue. This maps closely to LCSP: NestJS API owns request handling, RBAC, state validation and job enqueue; Python workers own scan, profile, AIUsageFlow, reconciliation, legal matching, classification, gap analysis and document generation. Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/

Azure also frames architecture styles as constraints that shape allowed elements and relationships. This is important for LCSP task templates: each task should declare which architectural style constraints it must preserve. For example, scanner tasks must preserve API/worker separation; legal tasks must preserve approved corpus/index boundaries; classification tasks must preserve VerifiedProfile plus LegalRuleMatch prerequisites. Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/

Recommended LCSP system architecture model:

- **NestJS API boundary**: synchronous requests, identity/session, RBAC, state guards, audit, outbox writes, status projections.
- **Python Worker Platform**: asynchronous domain workloads with one command family per worker.
- **Event/outbox backbone**: durable handoff between state mutation and worker events.
- **Legal retrieval subsystem**: ChromaDB vectorless legal index with citation allowlist and retrieval audit.
- **Artifact subsystem**: object storage with metadata refs and no raw source/secret leakage.
- **Audit subsystem**: append-oriented material event history across domains.

_Source:_ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/, `docs/implementation/backend-implementation.md`, `docs/implementation/python-worker-platform-implementation.md`

### Design Principles and Best Practices

The implementation-task template should force design decisions to be explicit. Azure's architecture guidance emphasizes choosing patterns based on the problem/constraint, not the technology, and warns that every pattern has trade-offs. LCSP should encode this in task docs as "pattern selected", "problem solved", "trade-offs accepted", and "constraints preserved." Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/

AWS Well-Architected identifies six pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability. LCSP does not need to become AWS-specific, but these pillars are useful as a generic checklist for task handoff quality. Each implementation task should at least state which pillars it touches and what evidence/verification is expected. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html

For LCSP, design principles should be:

- **Deny by default**: RBAC/state/citation/evidence gates fail closed.
- **Reference-only async payloads**: queue messages carry IDs and safe refs, not raw source, secrets, or full prompts.
- **Idempotent transitions**: duplicate commands must not duplicate artifacts.
- **Version everything material**: profile, evidence, corpus, legal matching, classification, document, audit.
- **Trace before conclude**: no classification/document claim without evidence/legal/citation trace.
- **No hidden authority drift**: removed/superseded concepts stay guarded in tasks.

_Source:_ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html

### Scalability and Performance Patterns

LCSP does not currently need high-scale microservice machinery, but it does need reliable workload isolation. Azure's Web-Queue-Worker style supports independent scaling between front-end/API and worker components. Azure's cloud pattern catalog also includes Asynchronous Request-Reply, Bulkhead, Circuit Breaker, Claim Check, Choreography, and Competing Consumers style patterns that are relevant to LCSP worker-heavy flows. Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/

Task handoffs should use these patterns selectively:

- **Asynchronous request-reply** for API request -> job/status polling.
- **Bulkhead** for isolating scanner/legal/LLM/document worker failure domains.
- **Circuit breaker** for LLM provider, ChromaDB, object storage, GitHub API, and RabbitMQ dependencies where implemented.
- **Claim check** for large/sensitive artifacts: store payload in object storage or DB; queue only safe refs.
- **Competing consumers** for worker queue scaling, subject to idempotency and ordering rules.

For LCSP, performance/scalability fields in each task should include:

```text
Expected workload:
Timeout/bounds:
Concurrency:
Backpressure:
Retry/DLQ:
Large payload strategy:
Status projection:
```

_Source:_ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/

### Integration and Communication Patterns

The most important architectural pattern for LCSP is **Transactional Outbox**. Microservices.io explains the problem: a service often must update its database and send a message, but traditional distributed transactions across DB and broker are not a good fit. The outbox solution stores the message in the database in the same transaction as business state, and a separate relay publishes it. It also warns that relays may publish more than once, so consumers must be idempotent. Source: https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html

LCSP already uses this pattern in its implementation docs. Every task that mutates state and triggers downstream work must explicitly document:

- domain transaction boundary;
- audit event in same transaction where required;
- outbox event row;
- publisher/relay behavior;
- idempotent consumer behavior;
- duplicate publication handling;
- terminal success/failure event.

For architecture handoffs, add a **Messaging Contract** block to every async task and a **Workflow Chain** map to every wave handoff.

### Security Architecture Patterns

LCSP is a security-sensitive compliance-support system, so every task brief needs a security architecture section even when the task is not "security work".

OWASP's Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet frames threat modeling as a way to identify risks early, improve security awareness, and improve visibility of the target of evaluation. LCSP task templates should require a lightweight threat model for tasks that add API routes, worker commands, provider calls, repository access, source snapshots, legal corpus ingestion, classification, document generation, or audit export. Source: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html

For LCSP, the security architecture section should require:

- actor/service identity;
- tenant/organization boundary;
- RBAC decision and policy version;
- secrets/config refs;
- sensitive data entering/leaving the component;
- redaction requirement;
- abuse/negative cases;
- audit event;
- recovery/fail-closed behavior.

Security patterns to preserve:

- **Zero trust between boundaries**: API, workers, queues, providers, and object storage validate context.
- **Least privilege**: GitHub App read-only; Developer scoped; Internal Legal Operator only for corpus approval.
- **Safe-by-default output**: no legal/classification/report overclaim without evidence/citation.
- **Threat model at task granularity** for sensitive boundary changes.

_Source:_ https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html

### Data Architecture Patterns

LCSP uses controlled polyglot persistence:

- PostgreSQL for canonical metadata/state/audit/outbox/idempotency.
- ChromaDB for legal retrieval index.
- Object storage for snapshots and generated artifacts.
- RabbitMQ for message transport.

This should be represented as **bounded data ownership**, not arbitrary data sprawl. Each task must declare which store it touches, whether it creates a new schema/table/index/bucket/collection, and how that data is versioned and audited.

The Claim Check pattern is especially relevant. Azure describes the pattern as splitting a large message into a claim check plus payload to avoid overwhelming the message bus. LCSP should apply this broadly: queue messages should carry safe references to evidence reports, snapshots, legal corpus versions, retrieval audits, generated documents, and object storage keys. They should not carry raw source, secrets, or full prompts. Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/claim-check

For LCSP task templates, data architecture fields should include:

```text
Persistence owner:
Tables/entities:
Indexes/collections:
Object storage refs:
Versioning:
Retention:
Redaction:
Audit linkage:
Migration/rollback:
```

_Source:_ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/claim-check

### Deployment and Operations Architecture

LCSP task/handoff docs should not assume deployment authorization, but deployable tasks should still document operational shape. AWS Well-Architected's pillars are useful to check whether a task has operational excellence, security, reliability, performance, cost, and sustainability considerations documented. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html

For LCSP, operational architecture differs by task type:

- API tasks: route health, validation errors, status projection, audit, RBAC denial.
- Worker tasks: queue binding, concurrency, retry/DLQ, idempotency, shutdown behavior.
- Scanner tasks: workspace cleanup, resource bounds, tool failure severity.
- Legal tasks: corpus approval, index build state, citation allowlist, retrieval audit.
- LLM/classification tasks: provider outage, invalid schema, token/cost limits, fail-closed states.
- Document/audit tasks: artifact storage, download authorization, redacted export.

The engineering handoff should therefore include an **Operations Contract** section:

```text
Runtime:
Startup dependencies:
Shutdown behavior:
Health/status signal:
Logs/audit:
Metrics/counters:
Failure codes:
Runbook entry:
Rollback/backout:
```

_Source:_ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html

### Architectural Template Implications for LCSP

The final LCSP handoff templates should include these architecture-specific sections:

```text
Architecture Style
Boundary Changed
Pattern Applied
Trade-offs Accepted
State/Data Ownership
Integration Contract
Security/Threat Model Notes
Operational Contract
Traceability
Non-Goals / Guardrails
Verification / Evidence
```

For task docs, the most important rule is: no task may be "just implement X." It must explain what architectural boundary changes, what contract is created or modified, what downstream work depends on it, and how the change remains compatible with LCSP's fail-closed compliance flow.

## Implementation Approaches and Technology Adoption

### Technology Adoption Strategies

LCSP should use incremental adoption by vertical domain slice rather than a big-bang implementation. The adoption sequence should move through explicit product and architecture boundaries: RBAC/authz, legal corpus, scanner, TechnicalProfile, AIUsageFlow, validation/reporting, document generation, and audit export. This matches the Strangler Fig pattern: replace specific functionality gradually, keep existing behavior stable while new pieces are introduced, and decommission older behavior only after validation.

For LCSP implementation tasks, this means every task must state:

- existing behavior affected;
- new canonical owner;
- rollback or backout path;
- temporary bridge or adapter, if any;
- decommission condition for stale docs, commands, routes, workers, or indexes.

This is directly relevant to the current LCSP documentation state because the project has already used consolidation passes to retire old authority files, redirects, pgvector legal retrieval, RBAC wording, structured attestation, and ambiguous scanner-worker boundaries. Future task templates should prevent the same drift by requiring each task to name what it supersedes.

_Source:_ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler-fig

### Development Workflows and Tooling

LCSP should route implementation work through pull-request workflow with explicit review and status gates. GitHub branch protection can require pull request reviews, required status checks, conversation resolution, signed commits, linear history, merge queue, and successful deployments before merge. For LCSP, these controls are useful because most tasks change authoritative documents, contracts, or cross-runtime behavior; merge should depend on evidence that the related docs and contracts stayed synchronized.

The LCSP implementation-task template should include a workflow checklist:

- docs updated;
- contracts updated;
- implementation files listed;
- verification evidence attached;
- traceability rows updated;
- rollback note included;
- operational note included where runtime behavior changes.

The handoff template should also identify required reviewers by authority boundary: product/FR, architecture/ADR, backend API, Python worker, scanner, legal RAG, authz/security, UX, or traceability.

_Source:_ https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches

### Testing and Quality Assurance

The user has temporarily deferred test execution work, but implementation task documents should remain evidence-ready. Each task should map acceptance criteria to the intended verification level even when automation is deferred. For LCSP, that means the task template should never say only "add tests"; it should specify the expected verification surface:

- API contract;
- worker command/event behavior;
- RBAC authorization;
- duplicate/out-of-order/idempotency behavior;
- legal citation provenance and allowlist;
- scanner evidence/confidence;
- error states and recovery;
- UI journey;
- documentation-only validation where no runtime exists yet.

This keeps later ATDD and automation work traceable to the implementation plan without forcing test implementation before the user-authorized step.

_Source:_ https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance

### Deployment and Operations Practices

LCSP is a web + queue + worker workflow architecture. Any task that changes runtime behavior must carry an operational contract, not just code instructions. Required operational fields:

- command/event names;
- queue binding;
- producer and consumer;
- retry behavior;
- DLQ behavior;
- idempotency key;
- correlation and causation IDs;
- audit event;
- observability signal;
- operator response.

Google SRE guidance treats playbooks as practical instructions that help responders understand impact, debug, mitigate, and recover from automated alerts. LCSP should apply this to worker failures, DLQ saturation, cleanup failures, provider outage, invalid schema, legal citation rejection, scanner partial coverage, and document guardrail violations.

_Source:_ https://sre.google/workbook/on-call/

### Team Organization and Skills

LCSP implementation tasks should be organized around ownership boundaries rather than generic feature labels. Recommended owner categories:

- backend API;
- Python Worker Platform;
- scanner worker;
- legal corpus and ChromaDB vectorless retrieval;
- frontend UX;
- RBAC/security;
- persistence and migrations;
- documentation and traceability.

If a task crosses more than one boundary, the handoff must identify the lead owner, required supporting reviewers, and the contract between them. This is especially important for TechnicalProfile and AIUsageFlow because the user has explicitly clarified that both must exist: TechnicalProfile describes technical capability/evidence, while AIUsageFlow describes how AI is used in business workflows based on TechnicalProfile trace and TechnicalEvidenceReport claims.

_Source:_ https://arc42.org/overview

### Cost Optimization and Resource Management

AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization frames cost-optimized workloads as those that achieve business outcomes at the lowest practical cost while meeting functional requirements. It highlights practices such as cost awareness, cost-effective resources, demand/supply management, and ongoing optimization. For LCSP task templates, this should become a lightweight resource-impact section rather than a full financial model.

The section should be required when a task changes:

- ChromaDB storage/indexing;
- legal corpus snapshot retention;
- object storage artifacts;
- scanner subprocess runtime;
- queue throughput or retry behavior;
- LLM/provider invocation;
- audit export volume;
- generated document retention.

_Source:_ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/welcome.html

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Google's Four Keys/DORA framing measures software delivery through deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and time to restore service. These should be used by LCSP as team/system health metrics, not as individual performance metrics. The template should also include LCSP-specific technical risk categories:

- behavioral regression;
- contract drift;
- authorization bypass;
- event duplication or out-of-order delivery;
- data migration/versioning errors;
- legal citation provenance failure;
- scanner false confidence;
- UX mismatch;
- stale authority references;
- undocumented runtime failure mode.

Every task should include mitigation notes for risks it touches, plus an explicit "not applicable" marker for risk categories that do not apply.

_Source:_ https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance

## Technical Research Recommendations

### Implementation Roadmap

LCSP should create a four-layer implementation documentation set:

1. `implementation-plan.md`: wave-level roadmap and dependency overview.
2. `implementation-task-template.md`: task-level build brief.
3. `engineering-handoff-template.md`: wave/domain handoff packet for developer execution and review.
4. `operational-runbook-template.md`: runtime/worker/deploy failure guidance for tasks that introduce operational states.

Generated task documents should live under:

```text
docs/implementation/tasks/
docs/implementation/handoffs/
docs/implementation/runbooks/
```

### Technology Stack Recommendations

Use Markdown with YAML frontmatter for all task/handoff/runbook docs. Recommended stable task ID format:

```text
TASK-<epic-number>-<sequence>-<short-slug>
```

Every implementation task should include trace fields:

- UC;
- FR;
- NFR;
- BR;
- ADR;
- AC;
- story;
- UX artifact;
- source authority docs.

Every integration task should include contract tables for API, event, queue, authz, data, artifact, audit, and observability impacts.

### Skill Development Requirements

LCSP implementation contributors need enough domain familiarity to distinguish:

- TechnicalProfile from AIUsageFlow;
- scanner evidence from human attestation;
- ChromaDB vectorless legal retrieval from pgvector/embedding retrieval;
- RBAC policy evaluation from role authority;
- referenced legal context from primary match;
- redirect/historical docs from active authority docs.

Task docs should include links to source authority files so engineers and agents do not infer these distinctions from stale docs.

### Success Metrics and KPIs

Recommended implementation documentation metrics:

- 100% P0 stories have implementation tasks.
- 100% tasks cite source authority docs.
- 100% async tasks include queue/event/idempotency/retry/DLQ/audit contracts.
- 100% legal retrieval tasks include citation allowlist/context-role/versioning contracts.
- 0 tasks use `docs/archive/` or redirect files as source of truth.
- 0 tasks introduce implementation scope without traceability to UC/FR/NFR/BR/ADR/AC/story.

Recommended delivery metrics:

- lead time from task approval to PR merge;
- change failure rate for task PRs that touch runtime behavior;
- time to restore service for worker/API operational incidents;
- count of reopened docs due to authority conflict;
- count of failed readiness checks caused by missing traceability.

# LCSP Implementation Task and Engineering Handoff Templates: Comprehensive Technical Research

## Executive Summary

LCSP needs implementation documentation that is stricter than a normal product backlog. The project has compliance, legal-citation, scanner-evidence, RBAC authorization, asynchronous workflow, and documentation-authority constraints. A task that only says "implement story X" is not sufficient because engineers and AI coding agents can otherwise infer behavior from stale docs, redirect files, or superseded concepts such as RBAC, structured attestation, pgvector legal retrieval, or ambiguous scanner authority.

The research supports a four-artifact implementation documentation model: implementation task template, engineering handoff template, operational runbook template, and generated task/handoff/runbook documents per wave or epic. These artifacts should be stored in the active `docs/implementation/` tree and should cite only active authority documents. Archive docs and redirect stubs must not be used as task authority.

**Key Technical Findings:**

- LCSP's effective architecture is `web + queue + worker` with event-driven workflows, not a pure monolith or pure microservice system.
- Task docs must bind product, architecture, UX, specs, implementation, traceability, and verification intent into one actionable packet.
- Async domain tasks require command/event/queue/idempotency/retry/DLQ/audit contracts.
- Legal retrieval tasks require ChromaDB vectorless, stable hierarchical legal IDs, context roles, versioning, xref expansion, and citation allowlist behavior.
- TechnicalProfile and AIUsageFlow must remain distinct implementation domains: TechnicalProfile captures technical capability/evidence; AIUsageFlow explains how AI is used in business workflows based on TechnicalProfile trace and TechnicalEvidenceReport claims.

**Technical Recommendations:**

- Create `docs/implementation/templates/implementation-task-template.md`.
- Create `docs/implementation/templates/engineering-handoff-template.md`.
- Create `docs/implementation/templates/operational-runbook-template.md`.
- Generate task files under `docs/implementation/tasks/` using stable `TASK-<epic>-<sequence>-<slug>` IDs.
- Generate handoff files under `docs/implementation/handoffs/` for wave/domain execution packets.
- Keep test execution temporarily deferred per owner direction, but require every task to include verification intent and evidence hooks.

## 1. Technical Research Introduction and Methodology

### Technical Research Significance

Implementation task and engineering handoff templates are critical for LCSP because the project is now transitioning from canonical planning artifacts into executable implementation work. The handoff layer must prevent authority drift across UC, FR, NFR, BR, ADR, architecture, specs, implementation, UX, epics, stories, AC, and traceability.

The current industry context supports this approach. GitLab documents repository-native description templates for consistent issue/task/merge-request structure. Atlassian's story guidance emphasizes definition of done, owners, ordered work, and sprint-sized slices. arc42 and C4 provide mature architecture communication patterns. 12-Factor and SRE guidance provide runtime/deployment/playbook constraints for service-style systems.

_Technical Importance:_ LCSP task docs must be executable by both engineers and AI coding agents without relying on unstated context.
_Business Impact:_ Better handoff reduces compliance regressions, stale authority use, implementation ambiguity, and readiness failures.
_Sources:_ https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/description_templates/, https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories, https://arc42.org/overview, https://c4model.com/

### Technical Research Methodology

The research used active LCSP docs plus current external technical sources. The analysis covered:

- technology stack and template structures;
- integration patterns for API, event, queue, outbox, authz, and audit contracts;
- architecture patterns for web/worker/event-driven systems;
- implementation adoption and migration patterns;
- operational, cost, risk, and delivery metrics.

Archive docs were not treated as authority. External sources were used to verify template and engineering-practice claims, not to override LCSP-specific canonical decisions.

### Technical Research Goals and Objectives

**Original Technical Goals:** Research implementation task, engineering handoff, task brief, and deployment guidance templates suitable for LCSP; produce a grounded basis for creating task-level implementation documents.

**Achieved Technical Objectives:**

- Identified the required LCSP template set.
- Defined mandatory task-level contract sections.
- Mapped LCSP architecture and integration constraints into handoff requirements.
- Established verification-intent requirements while test execution remains deferred.
- Produced roadmap and success metrics for generating implementation task docs.

## 2. LCSP Technical Landscape and Architecture Analysis

### Current Technical Architecture Patterns

LCSP should document implementation work as a `web + queue + worker` architecture. The NestJS/API boundary handles synchronous user/API workflows, request validation, state handoff, RBAC decision points, persistence writes, outbox records, and read/status projections. The Python Worker Platform owns asynchronous domain workloads such as scan triggers, repository-analysis runtime, TechnicalProfile, AIUsageFlow, reconciliation, legal ingestion/index/matching, classification, gap analysis, document generation, and audit export if retained as a worker flow.

_Dominant Patterns:_ event-driven workflow, transactional outbox, worker queue processing, structure-first legal retrieval, fail-closed compliance workflow.
_Architectural Evolution:_ LCSP has moved away from Node worker ambiguity, pgvector legal retrieval, structured attestation, and duplicate scanner authority.
_Architectural Trade-offs:_ Explicit contracts and task docs add process overhead, but reduce implementation ambiguity and compliance drift.
_Sources:_ https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/

### System Design Principles and Best Practices

The task template must represent architecture as boundaries and contracts, not only files to edit. Required design fields:

- architecture style;
- boundary changed;
- pattern applied;
- trade-offs accepted;
- state/data ownership;
- integration contract;
- security/threat model notes;
- operational contract;
- traceability;
- non-goals/guardrails;
- verification/evidence.

_Source:_ https://arc42.org/overview

## 3. Implementation Approaches and Best Practices

### Current Implementation Methodologies

The best implementation methodology for LCSP is incremental, domain-sliced execution. The Strangler Fig pattern supports gradual replacement of functionality through clear service boundaries, validation, and eventual decommissioning. In LCSP, this maps to retiring superseded docs/behaviors as part of task acceptance, not leaving them as ambiguous references.

_Development Approach:_ vertical slices by domain/workflow.
_Code Organization Pattern:_ runtime owner plus authority docs plus contract tables.
_Quality Assurance Practice:_ verification intent per AC, even when automation is deferred.
_Deployment Strategy:_ deployable tasks require operational runbook fields.
_Source:_ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler-fig

### Implementation Framework and Tooling

Use Markdown + YAML frontmatter for task/handoff/runbook docs. This keeps artifacts reviewable in PRs, friendly to AI coding agents, and easy to trace from epics/stories/AC to implementation.

Recommended generated directories:

```text
docs/implementation/templates/
docs/implementation/tasks/
docs/implementation/handoffs/
docs/implementation/runbooks/
```

_Sources:_ https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/description_templates/, https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories

## 4. Technology Stack Evolution and Current Trends

### Current Technology Stack Landscape

LCSP task docs should assume a polyglot stack:

- TypeScript/NestJS/Prisma for API, DTO, validation, persistence, RBAC, outbox, and status/read models.
- Python Worker Platform for asynchronous domain work.
- RabbitMQ for command/event transport.
- PostgreSQL for metadata, workflow state, audit, outbox, and idempotency.
- ChromaDB for structure-first vectorless legal retrieval.
- Object storage for snapshots, generated artifacts, and large evidence references.
- Markdown/YAML for docs, templates, traceability, and task handoffs.

_Source:_ https://12factor.net/

### Technology Adoption Patterns

Task templates should prevent old and new architectures from coexisting as equal authority. Each task should explicitly name any superseded behavior or redirect file it retires. This is mandatory for areas with recent drift: scanner docs, worker platform docs, ChromaDB vectorless legal retrieval, readiness markers, UX draft rebase, and AIUsageFlow/TechnicalProfile semantics.

_Source:_ https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html

## 5. Integration and Interoperability Patterns

### Current Integration Approaches

LCSP implementation tasks must include integration contracts when changing:

- API routes;
- command/event messages;
- queue bindings;
- outbox publishing;
- idempotency keys;
- state transitions;
- audit events;
- authorization checks;
- downstream worker dependencies.

API design should expose resource/state contracts rather than database internals. Google AIP-121's resource-oriented design guidance is useful for this distinction.

_Sources:_ https://google.aip.dev/121, https://cloudevents.io/, https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python

### Interoperability Standards and Protocols

For event payload discipline, task docs should require event names, schema refs, correlation IDs, causation IDs, producer, consumer, retry behavior, DLQ behavior, and audit linkage. CloudEvents is a useful reference for standard event metadata shape even if LCSP does not adopt it wholesale.

_Source:_ https://cloudevents.io/

## 6. Performance and Scalability Analysis

### Performance Characteristics and Optimization

The task template should ask for resource impact only where it matters. Performance-sensitive LCSP areas include scanner subprocess limits, legal corpus ingestion/indexing, ChromaDB full-text/filter lookup, queue retry volume, worker concurrency, object storage artifact size, and LLM/provider calls.

_Source:_ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html

### Scalability Patterns and Approaches

LCSP should scale via queue/worker concurrency, idempotent processing, bounded scanner execution, claim-check payload references, and state projections. Queue messages should not carry full source snapshots, full legal text, raw prompts, secrets, or large artifacts. Azure's Claim Check pattern supports sending references to large payloads rather than pushing the entire payload through the messaging system.

_Source:_ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/claim-check

## 7. Security and Compliance Considerations

### Security Best Practices and Frameworks

Task docs must include RBAC, audit, artifact access, redaction, provenance, and threat notes when security-sensitive behavior changes. OWASP API Security risks are relevant for API tasks, especially broken authorization, object/property-level authorization, unrestricted resource consumption, and unsafe consumption of APIs.

_Source:_ https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/

### Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

LCSP has legal/compliance-specific requirements that must be task-level guardrails:

- no structured human attestation in MVP;
- no citation outside retrieved/referenced allowlist;
- legal retrieval must preserve document/article/clause/point hierarchy;
- expired legal text must not be retrieved for new assessments;
- referenced context cannot be presented as primary match;
- audit trail must capture decision-critical events.

_Source:_ https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html

## 8. Strategic Technical Recommendations

### Technical Strategy and Decision Framework

Recommended decision framework for each implementation task:

```text
What authority permits this task?
What behavior does this task create/change/remove?
What architecture boundary changes?
What contracts change?
What runtime owns it?
What data/state does it own?
What failures must be fail-closed?
What evidence proves it is done?
What old behavior is superseded?
```

ADR-linked tasks should also include decision status and open-decision carry-forward where applicable.

_Source:_ https://arc42.org/overview

### Competitive Technical Advantage

LCSP's technical advantage is not a novel template format. It is the discipline of binding legal provenance, scanner evidence, authorization, async workflow, and UX/story traceability into execution artifacts. That makes implementation safer for both human engineers and AI coding agents.

## 9. Implementation Roadmap and Risk Assessment

### Technical Implementation Framework

Recommended sequence:

1. Create implementation templates.
2. Generate first-pass task docs for current P0/P1 stories.
3. Generate wave-level handoffs for foundations, assessment core, scanner/profile, AIUsageFlow, legal/RAG, validation/reporting, documents/audit.
4. Add runbooks only for tasks with runtime/worker/deploy impact.
5. Rebuild traceability from task IDs back to epic/story/AC and source authority docs.
6. Run readiness again after task docs exist.

### Technical Risk Management

Key risks:

- task uses stale redirect/archive authority;
- task merges TechnicalProfile and AIUsageFlow semantics;
- task omits async retry/DLQ/idempotency;
- legal task omits citation allowlist;
- scanner task reintroduces duplicate Python spec authority;
- UX task diverges from ChromaDB/RBAC/AIUsageFlow constraints;
- task lacks verification intent and cannot be covered later by ATDD/automation.

Mitigation: require source authority refs, non-goals, contracts, verification intent, and reviewer boundary in every task.

## 10. Future Technical Outlook and Innovation Opportunities

### Emerging Technology Trends

AI coding agents increase the value of precise implementation handoffs. Current research on agentic software engineering emphasizes planning, navigation, code editing, execution, intent clarification, and verification as core workflow needs. LCSP should assume agent-assisted implementation will continue, and therefore task docs must make intent, boundaries, non-goals, and verification explicit.

_Sources:_ https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16299, https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17343

### Innovation and Research Opportunities

Future LCSP improvements:

- generate task docs automatically from stories/AC and traceability matrices;
- validate task docs for missing contracts;
- lint docs for archive/redirect authority references;
- generate ATDD skeletons from task verification sections;
- generate runbooks from operational contracts;
- produce readiness deltas from task coverage.

### Technical Research Quality Assurance

Claims about external practice were verified against current web sources. LCSP-specific claims were derived from active project documents already reviewed during the workflow and from the user's explicit canonical decisions in this thread. The research intentionally does not treat `docs/archive/` or redirect files as authority.

_Technical Confidence Level:_ High for template strategy and LCSP handoff requirements; medium for future automation opportunities until actual implementation tooling exists.

## Technical Research Conclusion

LCSP should proceed from research into document creation: first templates, then generated task/handoff docs for current epics and stories. The templates should be strict enough to prevent stale authority, ambiguous runtime ownership, and missing integration contracts, while still lightweight enough to use in normal PR workflow.

**Next Steps:**

1. Add the three template files under `docs/implementation/templates/`.
2. Generate initial task docs for current P0/P1 implementation stories.
3. Generate wave/domain handoffs, especially for TechnicalProfile and AIUsageFlow.
4. Rebuild task-to-story traceability.
5. Re-run readiness after task docs exist.
