## PRD Analysis

PRD source read completely:

- `docs/product/prd.md`

Canonical requirement catalogs read completely:

- `docs/specs/functional-requirements.md`
- `docs/specs/non-functional-requirements.md`

The PRD states that `FR-001..FR-056` are the canonical functional requirement identifiers for implementation, acceptance, traceability, and story work. Legacy `FR-E*` headings remain narrative/source aliases only.

### Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Category | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-001 | Security | Password, OAuth/OIDC and session authentication controls must prevent unauthorized workspace access. |
| NFR-002 | Security | Sessions must expire, be revocable and respect MFA/auth policy. |
| NFR-003 | Security | MFA secrets and OTP verification must avoid plaintext secret storage and reject invalid, expired or replayed codes. |
| NFR-004 | Security | Login, MFA and reset flows must rate-limit repeated failures. |
| NFR-005 | Security | OAuth/OIDC callback handling must validate redirect URI, state, nonce, issuer, audience, expiry and safe account linking. |
| NFR-006 | Security | OAuth/OIDC login must remain separate from GitHub App repository authorization. |
| NFR-007 | Security | GitHub App access must be read-only and limited to selected repositories for MVP. |
| NFR-008 | Security | RBAC must enforce organization-scoped authorization for customer APIs, internal APIs, worker identities, repository access, scan triggers, assessment transitions, legal operations, document downloads, audit exports and administrative operations. |
| NFR-009 | Security | Developer access must be scoped to assigned RBAC policy scope and revocable. |
| NFR-010 | Auditability | Material workflow, auth, RBAC decisions, delegation, evidence, scan trigger, conflict, classification and document events must be audited. |
| NFR-011 | Auditability | Audit trail must be append-oriented with controlled correction model. |
| NFR-012 | Privacy | Raw source code must never be sent to an LLM provider. |
| NFR-013 | Privacy | Raw source code must not be stored long term in persistent stores. |
| NFR-014 | Privacy | Technical findings must avoid unnecessary source/code exposure. |
| NFR-015 | Privacy | Secrets must be redacted before logs, findings, reports, prompts or audit records. |
| NFR-016 | Traceability | Accepted evidence reports and repository-analysis outputs must include provenance, version, config/ruleset hash and integrity metadata. |
| NFR-017 | Traceability | Legal classification outputs must trace to legal rule, citation and corpus version. |
| NFR-018 | Compliance Support | System must fail closed for missing critical evidence, unresolved conflict, unknown critical usage or missing legal citation. |
| NFR-019 | Compliance Support | Classification must use evidence-backed VerifiedProfile and LegalRuleMatch, not provider/model/framework presence alone. |
| NFR-020 | Compliance Support | Generated reports must not overclaim evidence, legal certainty, validation, certification or production readiness. |
| NFR-021 | Reliability | Long-running scan, legal matching, classification and document work must not depend on web request lifecycle. |
| NFR-022 | Availability | User-facing workflow must expose blocked/failed states with actionable next step. |
| NFR-023 | Performance | MVP scan and worker operations must be bounded by file-size, timeout, CPU, memory, output and retry policies. |
| NFR-024 | Scalability | API runtime and Python Worker Platform workloads must remain separable. |
| NFR-025 | Maintainability | Domain modules must have clear ownership of DTOs, tables, queues and state transitions. |
| NFR-026 | Observability | Evidence gate, queue, worker, classification and document failures must be visible with correlation ID. |
| NFR-027 | Accessibility | Web forms, status messages and document review screens should meet common accessibility expectations. |
| NFR-028 | Usability | Manager-facing Wizard and locked states must use business language and avoid unexplained implementation terms. |
| NFR-029 | Traceability | AIUsageFlow claims must carry evidence refs and uncertainty reasons for material fields. |
| NFR-030 | Reliability | Re-runs must preserve historical evidence/profile/classification chain rather than mutating prior records. |
| NFR-033 | Security/Control | LLM API calls must be protected by monthly cost budget boundaries and token usage caps. Dense embedding calls are not required for legal retrieval MVP and become future-scoped if later approved. |
| NFR-034 | Compliance Support | Pinned legal corpus snapshots (`LegalCorpusVersion`) must remain immutable, with updates governed by a formal review and approval process. |
| NFR-035 | Security | Managed Repository Analysis Agent must operate in the assessment-scoped MDA sandbox with commit-pinned repository input, bounded resources, no customer dependency installation or application execution, source-safe outputs, and explicit coverage limitations. |

Total active NFRs extracted: 33. `NFR-031` and `NFR-032` are legacy aliases only and are not active catalog rows.

### Additional Requirements

- RBAC is the authorization source of truth. Role labels are subject attributes, grouping labels, or policy templates only.
- Risk classification cannot run before WizardProfile, accepted technical evidence, evidence gates, reconciliation, and VerifiedProfile.
- Wizard-only outputs must remain readiness-only and must not show final risk or HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW labels.
- Structured attestation, Local/CI scanner report upload as an MVP evidence path, manual technical evidence JSON upload, and delegated free-form clarification screens must not reappear in active MVP scope.
- GitHub App read-only repository scan and Automatic Trusted Scan Initiation are the active MVP technical evidence path.
- Python Worker Platform owns asynchronous domain workloads; repository-analysis runtime is Python-worker based.
- Legal retrieval is ChromaDB structure-first vectorless, with stable hierarchy IDs, parent context, one-hop xref expansion, and citation allowlist validation.
- Real LLM provider integration is required for happy-path classification and document generation; deterministic mock mode is only suitable for tests/offline CI/dev without configured key.
- Audit trail must preserve wizard answers, evidence metadata, RBAC/trigger decisions, conflict resolution, VerifiedProfile, classification, legal citation trace, gap analysis, and generated document versions.

### PRD Completeness Assessment

The PRD and canonical catalogs provide complete identifier coverage for readiness validation. The PRD remains explicitly conditional and carries high-risk validation requirements around Wizard wording/completeness, legal corpus/rule reliability, RBAC and trusted-trigger abuse prevention, trusted-trigger idempotency/retry/DLQ/replay, scanner failure severity, and readiness-only report contents.

### Missing Requirements

No missing FR coverage found. All canonical FR identifiers `FR-001..FR-056` appear in `docs/planning-artifacts/epics.md`.

### Coverage Statistics

- Total PRD FRs: 56
- FRs covered in epics/stories/guardrails: 56
- Missing FRs: 0
- Extra FR IDs found in epics outside canonical range: 0
- Coverage percentage: 100%

### Coverage Caveat

The initial Step 3 coverage check validated FR-to-epic/story coverage only. Companion traceability and state-transition artifacts were added during remediation: `docs/test-artifacts/traceability/implementation-readiness-traceability-2026-06-25.md` and `docs/implementation/readiness/state-transition-authority.md`.

## UX Alignment Assessment

UX sources read completely:

- `docs/planning-artifacts/ux-designs/ux-LCSP-2026-06-24/DESIGN.md`
- `docs/planning-artifacts/ux-designs/ux-LCSP-2026-06-24/EXPERIENCE.md`

Architecture sources read completely:

- `docs/architecture/architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/multi-agent-system-architecture.md`

### UX Document Status

Found. Active UX authority is the rebased pair `DESIGN.md` and `EXPERIENCE.md`, with `canonical-ux-review-2026-06-25.md` confirming the UX review is complete for epic generation. Archived UX specs are explicitly excluded from active authority.

### UX to PRD Alignment

| UX Requirement Area | PRD / Requirement Alignment | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manager-owned A-to-Z path without mandatory Developer participation | PRD user journeys, RBAC model, and FR-010/FR-047 keep Developer optional. | Aligned |
| Readiness-only state before evidence with no risk label | PRD goals, FR-015, FR-040, NFR-020/NFR-028. | Aligned |
| Read-only GitHub repository connection and trusted scan initiation | PRD FR-016..FR-020, FR-049, FR-050. | Aligned |
| Evidence review with redacted findings, confidence, limitations, and refs | PRD FR-020..FR-023, FR-048, NFR-012..NFR-016. | Aligned |
| Manager conflict resolution before VerifiedProfile | PRD FR-026..FR-031. | Aligned |
| Citation-backed classification and legal citation drawer | PRD FR-032..FR-036, FR-056, NFR-017/NFR-018/NFR-034. | Aligned |
| Readiness-only export distinct from final report | PRD FR-039/FR-040 and report rules. | Aligned |
| Audit table/export with safe metadata | PRD FR-042/FR-043 and audit trail expectations. | Aligned |
| Excluded UX paths: structured attestation, manual evidence JSON upload, Local/CI upload, customer-facing corpus admin | PRD Phase 5.2L scope correction and FR-045/FR-046/FR-051/FR-052 statuses. | Aligned |

### UX to Architecture Alignment

| UX Need | Architecture Support | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operational web workbench with assessment overview, Wizard, evidence, conflicts, classification, documents, audit | `Web Frontend` plus `Backend API` synchronous control plane. | Supported |
| Gate-driven stepper and blocked/degraded state handling | Architecture mandates persisted object/event stages and explicit blocking conditions. | Supported |
| Scan progress, retry/re-run, redacted evidence review | Repository Integration, Managed Repository Analysis Agent, queue boundary, persistence, audit. | Supported, pending scanner severity decision |
| Legal citation inspection, corpus version, context roles, allowlist validation | ChromaDB Legal Retriever, Citation Guardrail, Legal Matching Worker. | Supported |
| Real LLM provider metadata and guarded output states | LLM Gateway, Classification Worker, Document Worker. | Supported |
| Developer task workspace with RBAC-scoped data boundaries | RBAC enforcement boundary and optional Developer collaboration invariant. | Supported, pending RBAC runtime decision |
| Audit trail filters by actor/action/correlation/policy/evidence/citation refs | Audit component plus material event invariant. | Supported |

### Alignment Issues

No critical UX/PRD/Architecture contradiction found in the active docs.

### Warnings

- UX approval still carries open dependencies: final Vietnamese microcopy, exact readiness-only export contents, Manager-visible wording for automatic trusted trigger mapping states, frontend component library choice, and whether key rendered screen mockups are required.
- Architecture support for RBAC-heavy UX and trusted-trigger UX is conditional on open technical decisions for RBAC runtime and trusted scan trigger idempotency/retry/DLQ/replay.
- Scanner UX for failed/partial evidence depends on the unresolved scanner failure severity table and tool version/config/ruleset hash policy.

## Epic Quality Review

Epics/stories source reviewed:

- `docs/planning-artifacts/epics.md`

### Epic Structure Validation

| Epic | User Value / Outcome | Independence Assessment | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Epic 1 - Secure Workspace and RBAC-Scoped Collaboration | Users can authenticate, enter workspace, and act within RBAC scope. | Stands alone as workspace/security foundation. | Pass |
| Epic 2 - Manager Assessment and Wizard Readiness | Manager can create assessment, complete Wizard, and receive readiness-only guidance. | Depends only on Epic 1 workspace/auth/RBAC. | Pass |
| Epic 3 - Trusted Repository Evidence and TechnicalProfile | Manager/scoped Developer can connect repository, scan, review redacted findings, and produce TechnicalProfile. | Depends on Epic 1 and can enhance Epic 2 output; no dependency on later epics. | Pass with technical-decision gates |
| Epic 4 - AIUsageFlow Claims and Uncertainty | LCSP creates evidence-backed business usage claims from Wizard/technical inputs. | Depends on Epic 2/3 outputs; no forward dependency. | Pass |
| Epic 5 - Reconciliation and VerifiedProfile | Manager resolves conflicts and VerifiedProfile is created. | Depends on Wizard, TechnicalProfile, AIUsageFlow; no forward dependency. | Pass |
| Epic 6 - Legal Corpus Retrieval and LegalRuleMatch Evidence | Internal legal operations and LCSP produce citation-backed LegalRuleMatch evidence. | Can be implemented after profile flow; supports classification without requiring Epic 7 first. | Pass |
| Epic 7 - Citation-Backed Classification | Manager receives final/blocked/degraded classification from VerifiedProfile and LegalRuleMatch. | Depends on Epic 5/6; no forward dependency. | Pass |
| Epic 8 - Gap Analysis, Guarded Documents, and Audit Trail | Manager receives gaps, guarded documents, versioned downloads, and audit trail. | Depends on classification for final report and supports readiness-only export independently. | Pass |

### Story Quality Assessment

- Total stories reviewed: 56.
- BDD structure check: all 56 stories include matched `Given` / `When` / `Then` acceptance criteria.
- Story-level coverage map exists and links stories to FR/control coverage.
- Negative/deferred requirements are handled as guardrail stories rather than active product journeys.
- Database/entity sequencing is acceptable: the epic artifact explicitly avoids creating all tables/entities upfront and defines domain artifacts at first use.
- No forward story dependency pattern such as “depends on future story” was found.

### Critical Violations

None found.

No technical epic was found that is merely “setup database”, “API development”, or “infrastructure setup” without domain value. Some stories are system/control stories using “As LCSP”, but they produce required compliance-control artifacts such as RBAC contract, audit/outbox contract, worker contract, evidence gates, citation guardrails, and output guardrails. These are acceptable because the product is gate-driven and compliance-critical, provided each remains independently testable.

### Major Issues

1. Required decision artifacts were unresolved at initial assessment time.
   - RBAC runtime is now resolved by `docs/implementation/decisions/rbac-runtime-decision.md`.
   - Automatic trusted scan trigger behavior is now resolved by `docs/implementation/decisions/trusted-scan-trigger-retry-dlq-replay-decision.md`.
   - Impact: these areas can proceed to sprint planning review with the decision artifacts cited.

2. Story-level traceability was not certification-grade at initial assessment time.
   - Remediated by `docs/test-artifacts/traceability/implementation-readiness-traceability-2026-06-25.md`.
   - The new traceability artifact maps AC IDs, test levels, owners, and expected evidence artifacts.
   - Impact: sprint planning can now use concrete trace rows; executable tests still need to be implemented or cited during build.

3. State-transition details were too high-level at initial assessment time.
   - Remediated by `docs/implementation/readiness/state-transition-authority.md`.
   - The new authority maps allowed transition, guard, audit event name, UI label class, and downstream eligibility.
   - Impact: teams now have a planning authority for transition implementation and conformance tests.

4. Greenfield execution setup was not explicit in the epics.
   - Remediated by `docs/implementation/tasks/modules/README.md`.
   - The implementation task catalog now tracks module task catalog before feature tasks.
   - Impact: engineering bootstrap is explicit for sprint planning.

### Minor Concerns

- Several system/control stories are intentionally technical. They should stay small and produce one testable artifact each; otherwise they can inflate during implementation.
- Acceptance criteria are testable. Planning-level AC IDs are now assigned in the traceability artifact; implementation stories may still add more granular executable test IDs.
- UX open dependencies should be converted into specific story acceptance constraints or design tasks, especially Vietnamese microcopy and readiness-only export content.

### Best Practices Compliance Checklist

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Epics deliver user/operator value | Pass | All epics map to Manager, Developer, Internal Legal Operator, audit, or compliance-control outcomes. |
| Epic independence | Pass | Dependency flow is sequential and no Epic N requires Epic N+1 to function. |
| Story sizing | Pass with caution | 56 stories are discrete, but technical control stories need implementation-task slicing. |
| No forward dependencies | Pass | No forward-story dependency pattern found. |
| Database/entity timing | Pass | Domain artifacts are introduced at first use; no all-tables-upfront story found. |
| Clear acceptance criteria | Pass with gates | BDD structure exists; AC IDs and trace rows still required. |
| FR traceability maintained | Pass | 56/56 FRs covered by stories or guardrails. |
| Implementation readiness | Ready for sprint planning review | Prior blockers are remediated by decision, traceability, state-transition, and bootstrap artifacts. |

### Remediation Guidance

- Use the companion traceability artifact for sprint planning and test task generation.
- Use the RBAC runtime decision artifact before implementing protected surfaces.
- Use the trusted scan trigger replay/retry/DLQ decision artifact before implementing scan orchestration.
- Use the scanner severity/tool-hash decision artifact before implementing TechnicalEvidenceReport readiness gates.
- Use the state-transition authority for evidence, reconciliation, legal matching, classification, and document flows.
- Use module task catalog to track greenfield engineering bootstrap before feature tasks.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

`READY_FOR_SPRINT_PLANNING_REVIEW`

LCSP documentation is now ready for sprint planning review after remediation. The prior readiness blockers have resolution artifacts. This status still does not authorize implementation by itself; sprint planning, owner signoff, and task-level acceptance remain required.

### Resolved Remediation Items

1. Required decision artifacts are now created.
   - RBAC runtime: `docs/implementation/decisions/rbac-runtime-decision.md`
   - Trusted scan trigger idempotency/retry/DLQ/replay/operator recovery: `docs/implementation/decisions/trusted-scan-trigger-retry-dlq-replay-decision.md`

2. Certification-grade planning traceability is now created.
   - Artifact: `docs/test-artifacts/traceability/implementation-readiness-traceability-2026-06-25.md`
   - It maps `FR/NFR/UX/control -> story ID -> acceptance criterion ID -> test level -> owner -> evidence artifact`.

3. State-transition authority is now created.
   - Artifact: `docs/implementation/readiness/state-transition-authority.md`
   - It maps allowed transitions, guards, audit event names, UI label classes, and downstream eligibility.

4. Greenfield execution setup is now tracked.
   - Artifact: `docs/implementation/tasks/modules/README.md`
   - Catalog entry added in `docs/implementation/tasks/README.md`.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Run sprint planning review against `module task catalog range`.
2. Assign owners for decision-artifact conformance tests listed in the traceability matrix.
3. Convert the traceability rows into executable test tasks as implementation work begins.
4. Keep UX open dependencies as sprint tasks or acceptance constraints: Vietnamese microcopy, readiness-only export contents, trusted trigger mapping wording, and component library decision.
5. Do not treat this report as build authorization without sprint planning approval.

### Final Note

This assessment originally identified 4 major issue categories and 3 minor concern categories. The 4 major readiness blockers have now been remediated with active planning artifacts. No missing FR coverage was found; all 56 canonical FRs are covered by active stories or explicit guardrails.
