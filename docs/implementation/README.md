# LCSP Implementation Documents

## Purpose

Active BUILD layer for the A-to-Z runnable MVP. These documents describe how the planned system will be built, configured, and verified after implementation readiness is certified.

## Current Authority Boundary

```text
CONSOLIDATION_PASS_APPLIED
SCANNER_BEHAVIOR_AUTHORITY_CONSOLIDATED
CHROMADB_VECTORLESS_DOMAIN_CONTRACT_ALIGNED
UX_ARTIFACT_REMOVED_FROM_ACTIVE_DOC_SET
STORY_TRACEABILITY_CREATED
IMPLEMENTATION_READINESS_READY_FOR_SPRINT_PLANNING_REVIEW
IMPLEMENTATION_NOT_AUTHORIZED_BY_READINESS_ALONE
```

Implementation documents are build specifications, not evidence that application code exists.

## Locked MVP Runtime Decisions

- LCSP Agent Runtime owns repository-analysis execution while the Python Worker Platform carries asynchronous assessment orchestration.
- Python Worker Platform owns all asynchronous domain workloads.
- Repository analysis uses native Deep Agents repository tools plus optional Codebase Memory MCP, with direct source verification and fail-closed coverage rules.
- Cross-language structural discovery is handled by the repository agent and optional Codebase Memory MCP; no dedicated ts-morph scanner subprocess is required.
- Real configured LLM provider is mandatory for A-to-Z acceptance; embedding provider is not required for legal retrieval MVP.
- Mock LLM is tests/offline development only.
- Legal corpus uses validated official-source snapshots, approval gate, immutable versioning, ChromaDB vectorless retrieval, legal hierarchy/xref assembly, and citation allowlist validation.
- Real S3-compatible object storage is required for A-to-Z acceptance.

## Internal Operations Boundary

Legal source validation, corpus review/approval, and index build are internal API/CLI operations for MVP. They are not Manager/Developer product UX screens.

## Non-Claims

- Not production deployment authorization.
- Not completed implementation readiness.
- Not legal validation or compliance certification.
- Not proof that code, tests, CI/CD, or infrastructure exist.
