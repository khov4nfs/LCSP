# LCSP Module-Scoped Feature Task Index

Each file here is one **implementable feature unit** within one module. Every task has complete coding information: exact file paths, API contract, Prisma models, commands/events, RBAC rules, and test cases.

## Why Small Tasks

A large task like "Organization and Assessment APIs" is ambiguous—a developer does not know which file to open first. A small task like "Create Assessment Endpoint" has one output, one set of files, and one verifiable acceptance.

## Task File Format

```
---
task_id: MW-<module>-<NNN>
module: <module>
runtime: nestjs-api | deepagents | web | cross-runtime
priority: P0 | P1
status: READY_FOR_DEV | IN_PROGRESS | DONE
epic_story: <story-id>
depends_on: [<relative-path>, ...]
---
```

Every task file contains:
- **Outcome** — one sentence
- **Module Files** — exact paths + action (Create/Modify/Verify)
- **API Contract** — endpoint, request, response, errors (for API tasks)
- **Worker Handler** — command, input, output, idempotency (for worker tasks)
- **Prisma Models Used** — table, action, fields
- **Business Rules** — the invariants the implementation must enforce
- **Commands / Events** — names, types, payloads
- **RBAC** — who can call this, what guard checks
- **Test Cases** — ID, scenario, expected result
- **Definition of Done**
