# LCSP Module Task Catalog

This is the active implementation task catalog. The previous coarse-grained `module task catalog range` briefs were removed because module-scoped tasks are now the build authority.

## Authority Rules

- Use task files under `docs/implementation/tasks/modules/**` as the active implementation backlog.
- Do not route implementation work to deleted legacy `module task catalog range` briefs or task handbooks.
- Use generated Jira CSV files in `docs/developer/jira-lcsp-*.csv` only after regenerating them from this module catalog.
- A task with `status: DONE` is implementation evidence, not a next-work candidate.
- A task with `status: READY_FOR_DEV` is eligible once its dependencies are done or explicitly waived by the story owner.

## Status Summary

| Status | Count |
|---|---:|
| `DONE` | 7 |
| `READY_FOR_DEV` | 84 |

Recounted 2026-07-05 directly from `docs/implementation/tasks/modules/**` frontmatter (91 task files total) after the Phase 5.2M task-sync audit found this table stale (previously 80 `READY_FOR_DEV`).

Titles for `6.1`–`8.7` corrected against `docs/developer/jira-lcsp-story-task-mapping.csv` (the prior table listed placeholder titles for `7.1`/`7.2`/`8.2` that do not correspond to any current task file's `epic_story` value). `6.3` is new (Phase 5.2M, `MW-lrc-001`).
