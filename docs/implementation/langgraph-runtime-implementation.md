# LangGraph Runtime Implementation

## Purpose

Define the authoritative runtime pattern for real LCSP business orchestration that uses LangChain and LangGraph inside the Python Worker Platform.

## Scope

This document applies to worker-owned runtime flows that need multi-step stateful orchestration with deterministic processing, retrieval, validation, and controlled LLM-assisted reasoning.

In MVP, the primary candidate flows are:

- `AIUsageFlow` claim assembly with uncertainty preservation
- Citation-backed classification
- Document generation after classification and gap-analysis gates

## Runtime Ownership

- Graph runtime lives in `deepagents`.
- Each graph is owned by a bounded worker module, not by the API layer.
- Queue events remain the entry point.
- Persisted domain artifacts remain the handoff contract between stages.

## Canonical Flow Pattern

```text
queue command/event
-> load immutable input artifact versions
-> deterministic normalization and policy gates
-> optional retrieval/composition steps
-> optional LLM-assisted reasoning node(s) through LLM Gateway
-> schema validation and deterministic guardrail checks
-> persist output artifact or blocked/degraded state
-> emit next event
```

## Node Taxonomy

| Node type | Allowed behavior | Forbidden behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic node | Load inputs, normalize evidence, compute rule-based fields, enforce gates, assemble persistence payloads | Calling providers directly, inventing unsupported evidence |
| Retrieval node | Fetch approved legal/material context by IDs, metadata filters, allowlists | Returning unapproved corpus content or bypassing citation policy |
| LLM-assisted node | Use sanitized structured inputs, approved prompt/template ref, schema-constrained output, fallback policy | Reading raw source, overriding deterministic evidence, persisting raw prompt/provider secret |
| Guardrail node | Validate schema, citations, uncertainty thresholds, workflow gates, state transitions | Silently downgrading failed outputs into success |
| Persistence node | Store immutable artifact versions and audit metadata, emit next event | Mutating prior authoritative artifacts in place |

## Required State Contract

Each LangGraph workflow run must carry:

- `assessment_id`
- `workflow_run_id`
- `artifact_versions`
- `node_name`
- `attempt`
- `sanitized_inputs`
- `guardrail_status`
- `llm_run_refs` when model nodes are used
- `blocked_or_degraded_reason` when applicable

The state contract must be serializable for checkpoint/retry/replay and must exclude raw source, secrets, full prompts, and full AST bodies.

## Durable Checkpoint and Replay Contract

Production and acceptance runs that require replay-safe graph execution configure `LANGGRAPH_CHECKPOINT_DATABASE_URL` with a PostgreSQL connection string. LCSP uses LangGraph's PostgreSQL checkpointer and `workflow_run_id` as the checkpoint `thread_id`.

Runtime behavior:

- A new workflow run starts from the supplied sanitized state and checkpoints after graph progress.
- A broker redelivery with the same `workflow_run_id` reads the existing thread before executing nodes.
- An incomplete thread resumes from the last successful checkpoint instead of restarting prior LLM or deterministic nodes.
- A completed thread returns its terminal checkpointed state and does not repeat the persistence node.
- Callback endpoints remain idempotent as a second safety boundary when a failure occurs after the external side effect but before its checkpoint is committed.
- `LANGGRAPH_CHECKPOINT_DATABASE_URL` may be unset for unit tests, offline CI, and isolated local component development; those runs use non-durable in-process graph execution and must not be presented as durable replay evidence.
- Invalid non-PostgreSQL checkpoint URLs fail configuration validation instead of silently degrading durability.

The checkpoint database stores graph runtime state only. Raw source code, secrets, full prompts, and full AST bodies remain forbidden from graph state and therefore from checkpoints.

## LangChain and LLM Gateway Integration

- LangChain may be used for prompt templating, structured output adapters, and retrieval composition helpers.
- LangChain provider wrappers must not call external providers directly from worker code.
- All external model invocations must traverse the LLM Gateway contract defined in `docs/implementation/llm-gateway-implementation.md`.
- Gateway metadata returned from a model call must be recorded in graph state by reference, not by raw prompt/body persistence.

## AIUsageFlow Guidance

- AIUsageFlow may use LangGraph to coordinate evidence loading, claim drafting, uncertainty analysis, and abstention checks.
- Deterministic evidence-derived facts remain the authority for what was technically observed.
- LLM-assisted reasoning, if used, is limited to mapping evidence-backed facts plus Wizard declarations into business-meaning claim proposals with explicit uncertainty handling.
- Provider/framework/package presence alone must never become a material business claim without supporting evidence and guardrail approval.
- The runtime must preserve all accepted repository-analysis evidence branches and source anchors rather than silently dropping bounded findings or AI-discovery signals from the Deep Agent structured result.
- All canonical AIUsageFlow claim categories remain evidence-gated; unresolved dynamic output-to-action paths must abstain rather than infer automated decision-making.

## Classification Guidance

- Classification graphs consume VerifiedProfile plus approved legal retrieval results only.
- Deterministic precedence rules and citation guardrails must run before and after any model-assisted reasoning node.
- A `LegalRuleMatch` with blocked guardrail status must not start the Classification graph.
- Provider failure, schema-invalid output, or citation gaps must end in blocked/degraded classification states according to node policy.

## Document Generation Guidance

- Document graphs start only after classification and gap-analysis completion.
- They may use LLM-assisted drafting nodes, but document claims must remain traceable to approved upstream artifacts.
- If required basis is missing, the graph fails closed.

## Operational Requirements

- Every graph needs idempotency keys tied to workflow run and artifact version inputs.
- Retry policy must be bounded and observable; broker retries carry an explicit delivery-attempt counter rather than relying on `x-death` for same-queue requeue behavior.
- Persistence/callback is a graph lifecycle node for worker-owned LangGraph flows so successful orchestration means the output handoff completed or was idempotently accepted.
- DLQ replay must rehydrate the same graph state contract or explicitly start a new versioned run.
- Observability must record graph start, node transition, retry, blocked/degraded outcome, LLM request references, and completion without sensitive payload leakage.
- Worker-only runtime read endpoints must require the worker API key and return persisted authoritative artifacts rather than trusting event payload duplication.

## Authority Notes

- This document defines runtime shape, not product scope.
- Story-level implementation artifacts must align to this runtime pattern when they introduce LangChain/LangGraph behavior.
- Older deterministic-only task documents that conflict with this authority must be revised or explicitly marked superseded during story implementation.
