# LCSP Requirements Traceability Matrix

> **Historical pre-freeze documentation.** This document records the earlier design or implementation. Current architecture authority is [the canonical Architecture Freeze](../../reports/architecture-freeze-migration-manifest.md); current runtime names and release status must be read there and in the current PR #367 receipts.

## Purpose

Canonical traceability from use cases to requirements, acceptance criteria, domain/state specifications, and implementation areas.

## UX and Story Boundary

UX has been rebased against the pruned active authority set and reviewed for epic generation. Story coverage is assessable through `docs/planning-artifacts/epics.md`; certification-grade planning traceability is captured in `docs/test-artifacts/traceability/implementation-readiness-traceability-2026-06-25.md`.
