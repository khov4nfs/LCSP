# Requirements Baseline

## Purpose

This document defines the active requirements baseline from existing active documents and historical traceability aliases. It does not create new requirements.

## Governance

- This document is authoritative for the recovered UC inventory, FR crosswalk, and NFR crosswalk.
- Canonical active FR namespace: `FR-001...` from `docs/specs/functional-requirements.md`.
- Canonical active NFR namespace: `NFR-001...` from `docs/specs/non-functional-requirements.md`.
- PRD `FR-E*` and `NFR-1..NFR-14` IDs are source aliases only. They are not active implementation requirement IDs after Phase 5.9 normalization.
- Legacy IDs remain traceability aliases recovered from historical requirement catalogs.
- Canonical FR inventory contains 56 total FRs. Phase 5.2L active MVP FRs are `FR-001..FR-044`, `FR-047..FR-050`, and `FR-053..FR-056`; `FR-045/FR-046` are `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`, `FR-051` is `REMOVED_FROM_PRODUCT`, and `FR-052` is `DEFERRED_POST_MVP`.
- Canonical active NFR inventory contains 33 active NFRs: `NFR-001..NFR-030` and `NFR-033..NFR-035`.
- `NFR-031` and `NFR-032` are legacy identifiers only, not active NFR catalog rows.
- `PLATFORM_BASELINE` means the active normalized requirement belongs to the platform baseline even when no one-to-one PRD source alias exists.
- Historical requirement catalogs remain non-authoritative and are not active source-of-truth documents.

## Active Canonical Sources

- `docs/product/prd.md`
- `docs/product/business-rules.md`

## Historical Recovery Inputs

Historical documents were used only to recover legacy IDs and traceability aliases. They remain available through git history and are not active implementation or requirements authority.

## PRD FR Source Alias Inventory

The following `FR-E*` identifiers are retained only as PRD/source aliases. Active implementation requirements use the `FR-001...` namespace in `docs/specs/functional-requirements.md`.

### Deferred Evidence Source Aliases

| PRD Alias | Active Canonical Requirement | MVP Scope Status          | Meaning                                                                                                                                    |

The active controlled MVP technical-evidence path is GitHub App repository connection, snapshot creation and Repository Scan.

## PRD NFR Source Alias Inventory

The following PRD `NFR-*` identifiers are retained only as PRD/source aliases. Active implementation NFRs use the `NFR-001...` namespace in `docs/specs/non-functional-requirements.md`.

| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| AC-1  | A Wizard-only assessment never displays HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. A technical-only assessment may display a classification once evidence and EngineeringRule gates pass; business-declaration-dependent fields remain `UNKNOWN` when unsupported. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-2  | Risk Classification cannot run before direct EngineeringRule assessment has evidence refs and legal-rule provenance.                                                                                                                     | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-3  | Technical evidence must pass schema completeness gate before reconciliation.                                                                                                                                                             | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-4  | Technical evidence must pass quality threshold gate before classification unlock.                                                                                                                                                        | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-5  | Any unresolved conflict blocks final classification/report until resolved.                                                                                                                                                               | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-6  | Manager conflict resolution is required and sufficient for MVP conflict completion when evidence gates pass.                                                                                                                             | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-7  | Evidence Confidence Score and AI Intervention Score never block workflow alone.                                                                                                                                                          | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-8  | Conflict handling uses binary MVP routing: conflict exists or not. Conflict Score may explain seriousness but does not create multiple routes.                                                                                           | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-9  | Human assertion, role label, delegated scope or untrusted upload cannot replace machine-generated metadata listed in A3.                                                                                                                 | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-10 | Final report includes legal citation/rule trace or is not final.                                                                                                                                                                         | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-11 | Final report has no attestation dependency and discloses evidence, legal basis, RBAC/trigger trace and limitations.                                                                                                                      | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-12 | Audit trail records wizard, evidence, conflict, RBAC/trigger, classification and document generation events.                                                                                                                             | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-13 | PRD preserves all mandatory product decisions from Product Brief.                                                                                                                                                                        | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-14 | PRD contains section for high-risk assumptions and validation requirements.                                                                                                                                                              | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-15 | PRD does not define architecture, backlog or code.                                                                                                                                                                                       | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-16 | PRD is clear enough for Architect Agent to identify product constraints and unresolved assumptions.                                                                                                                                      | docs/product/prd.md |
