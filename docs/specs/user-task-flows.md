# LCSP User Task Flows

## Purpose

This document defines canonical user-facing and system task flows for the A-to-Z runnable MVP. It is domain-level workflow input for UX and stories, not implementation guidance.

## Flow Conventions

- Canonical IDs are `UC-001..UC-017`, `FR-001..FR-056`, and `AC-001..AC-041` plus Phase 5.2L `AC-050A..AC-050F`.
- Manager can complete the active MVP without external collaborator participation.
- Developer invitation/task collaboration is retired from the active MVP.
- Structured attestation under historical `FR-045/FR-046` is `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP` and has no active task flow.
- Delegated technical clarification under `FR-052` is Deferred and must not appear as an active screen or task.
- `FR-050` is `AUTOMATIC_TRUSTED_SCAN_INITIATION`; there is no manual scanner report upload UI/API.
- `FR-051` manual technical evidence JSON upload is `REMOVED_FROM_PRODUCT`.
- RBAC is the final server-side authorization source of truth.
- Legal corpus administration is an internal operations/API/CLI flow, not Manager product UX.
- UI states must use plain business language and expose actionable blocked/failed outcomes.

## Manager Product Flows

| Traceability    | UC-001, UC-002; FR-001..FR-012; AC-021..AC-026                                          |

### 2. Create Assessment

| Field          | Content                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal           | Start a Manager-owned assessment.                                   |
| Preconditions  | Authenticated Manager belongs to organization.                      |
| Happy path     | Open assessment list, create assessment, enter name/context, save.  |

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal            | Capture business/legal context without requiring code knowledge.                                                                      |
| Preconditions   | Assessment exists and Manager owns it.                                                                                                |
| Happy path      | Answer purpose, sector, data, affected people, user impact, decision role, oversight, and external LLM questions; save draft; submit. |
| Locked behavior | Wizard-only state shows readiness/gaps, never a risk level.                                                                           |
| Failure states  | Required field missing, stale draft, validation error.                                                                                |
| Result          | WizardProfile version saved; assessment becomes `WIZARD_PROFILE_READY`.                                                               |

| Preconditions   | Assessment exists; actor has repository permission.                                            |
| Happy path      | Start GitHub App connection, select authorized repository and branch, confirm read-only scope. |
| Locked behavior | OAuth/OIDC login never grants repository access.                                               |
| Failure states  | App not installed, repository not selected, insufficient scope, revoked installation.          |
| Result          | RepositoryConnection exists; assessment becomes `REPOSITORY_CONNECTED`.                        |
| Traceability    | UC-005; FR-006, FR-016; AC-004, AC-023                                                         |

### 5. Select Commit and Create Snapshot

| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal           | Pin the evidence source before scanning.                                    |
| Preconditions  | RepositoryConnection exists.                                                |
| Happy path     | Select branch/commit, review commit metadata, create snapshot.              |
| Failure states | Commit unavailable, repository scope changed, provider error.               |
| Result         | Immutable RepositorySnapshot exists; assessment becomes `SNAPSHOT_CREATED`. |
| Traceability   | UC-006; FR-017; AC-004, AC-020                                              |

### 6. Run Repository Scan

| Field           | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Goal            | Request static analysis and monitor progress.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Preconditions   | Trusted integration context exists or Manager action creates trusted context.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Happy path      | Verified trigger creates or resumes a pending scan; Manager monitors queued/running/completed state.                                                                                                                                 |
| System behavior | Managed Repository Analysis Agent owns repository evidence derivation in a durable MDA sandbox; it uses native Deep Agents repository tools and optional Codebase Memory MCP, verifies material facts against source, and emits coverage/AI-discovery state without executing customer application dependencies. |
| Failure states  | Repository access failure, missing mapping, ambiguous assessment mapping, out-of-order trigger waiting, bounded parser/tool limitation, privacy/schema failure, TS/JS analyzer failure, workspace cleanup failure.                   |
| UX requirements | Show status, safe reason code, retry/rescan or mapping recovery action, and coverage limitations without raw source.                                                                                                                 |
| Result          | TechnicalEvidenceReport exists or explicit failed state.                                                                                                                                                                             |

| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal           | Understand what the system found and what remains uncertain.                                                                     |
| Preconditions  | Scan completed; TechnicalProfile/AIUsageFlow available or blocked.                                                               |
| Happy path     | Review detected AI usage, inputs, outputs, downstream actions, human-review signals, confidence, evidence refs, and limitations. |
| Privacy        | Show redacted metadata, file path/symbol/line refs, and hashes only; no raw source, secret, full prompt, or full AST.            |
| Failure states | Evidence insufficient, profile blocked, claims unclear, worker failed.                                                           |
| Result         | No state change by review alone.                                                                                                 |

| Happy path         | Open conflict, compare declared and detected values, inspect evidence refs, select resolution, enter rationale, submit. |
| Optional input     | None from structured attestation. Developer scoped collaboration is retired from the active MVP.                        |
| Locked behavior    | Manager is final resolver; scanner evidence is immutable; structured attestation is not an active MVP input.            |
| Deferred exclusion | No free-form delegated clarification task or screen under `FR-052`.                                                     |
| Failure states     | Missing rationale, stale conflict, unauthorized actor, unresolved blocking field.                                       |
| Result             | Reconciliation reruns; conflict remains open or VerifiedProfile becomes ready.                                          |
| Traceability       | UC-010, UC-011; FR-026..FR-031; AC-010..AC-015, AC-033                                                                  |

| Goal           | Confirm that the reconciled basis is ready for legal matching.                                               |
| Preconditions  | No unresolved material conflict.                                                                             |
| Happy path     | Review merged facts, evidence provenance, Manager resolutions, and version; approve where workflow requires. |
| Failure states | Conflict reopened, evidence stale, missing required claim.                                                   |
| Result         | `VERIFIED_PROFILE_READY`.                                                                                    |

| Goal           | Understand compliance gaps and required actions.                           |
| Preconditions  | Classification completed or explicitly eligible for degraded gap analysis. |
| Happy path     | Review gap items, priority, obligation/citation refs, and evidence basis.  |
| Failure states | Classification blocked, citation incomplete, worker failure.               |
| Result         | `GAP_ANALYSIS_READY` or `GAP_ANALYSIS_BLOCKED`.                            |

| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal           | Produce final compliance-support report or readiness-only export.                                  |
| Preconditions  | Final report requires valid classification, gap analysis, legal citations, and no conflict.        |
| Happy path     | Request generation, monitor status, preview metadata, download artifact.                           |
| Alternative    | Readiness-only export may be generated earlier and must contain no risk level.                     |
| Failure states | Guardrail violation, missing citation, object-storage error, provider failure, generation blocked. |
| Result         | `DOCUMENT_GENERATED` or `DOCUMENT_BLOCKED`.                                                        |

| Goal           | Trace decisions, versions, events, and blocked states.                                                 |
| Preconditions  | Assessment exists.                                                                                     |
| Happy path     | Filter events, inspect actor/action/object/version/correlation/evidence refs, export allowed metadata. |
| Privacy        | No raw source, secrets, raw provider tokens, or full prompts.                                          |
| Failure states | Export denied, unavailable event page, redaction failure.                                              |
| Result         | Auditable assessment record and export.                                                                |

## Retired Developer Product Flows

### 14. Developer Invitation and Scoped Task

| Field             | Content                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status            | Retired from active MVP.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Required behavior | No active Manager or Developer screen, route, form, DTO, command, BFF handler, entity, table, mock fixture, or delivery task may preserve invitation acceptance or scoped task workspace. |
| Historical rule   | `AUTH_INVITATION` audit resource values may remain only for historical audit compatibility.                                                                                               |
| Traceability      | Historical `FR-010`, `FR-011`, `FR-047`, `AC-025`, and `AC-026` only unless reopened by change control.                                                                                   |

### 15. Redacted Technical Findings

| Field             | Content                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status            | Active only as a server-side redaction/privacy behavior, not as a Developer task workspace.                                                          |
| Required behavior | Authorized Manager-facing evidence views show redacted metadata and evidence refs; unauthorized or non-Manager access is denied or narrowed by RBAC. |
| Traceability      | UC-007, UC-017; FR-048; AC-007, AC-022                                                                                                               |

### 16. Removed Structured Technical Attestation

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status            | `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Required behavior | No Manager or Developer active screen, route, form, DTO, command, event, entity, audit dependency, report dependency, acceptance criterion, epic, story, or delivery task may preserve structured attestation as an MVP feature. |
| Historical rule   | Prior records may remain in git history only. Reintroduction requires separate Project Owner approval.                                                                                                                           |
| Traceability      | Historical `FR-045/FR-046`, `UC-018`, and `AC-013` only.                                                                                                                                                                         |

## System Flows

### Repository Scan Orchestration

```text
command.scan.requested.v1
-> LangGraph Agent Runtime thread RUNNING
-> pinned snapshot hydrated into /workspace/repository
-> repository Deep Agent inventories languages/frameworks/build/config/runtime surfaces
-> native filesystem/search/shell/subagent investigation
-> optional Codebase Memory MCP index/search/trace/coverage assistance
-> direct-source verification and unresolved-frontier accounting
-> Deep Agent structured evidence graph + source anchors + AI discovery gate
-> evidence/report gates
-> event.scan.completed.v1 or event.scan.failed.v1
```

### Automatic Trusted Scan Initiation

```text
trusted trigger received
-> context validation
-> PENDING_MAPPING | BLOCKED_MAPPING | WAITING_FOR_CONTEXT | READY_TO_SNAPSHOT
-> snapshot pending
-> scan pending/running
-> completed or failed
```

Triggers include verified GitHub webhooks, scheduled integration triggers, backend-issued triggers, and authorized Manager actions that create trusted context. Duplicate and out-of-order events must not scan the wrong repository or assessment.

### Evidence-to-Profile Orchestration

```text
TechnicalEvidenceReport QUALITY_VALID
-> TechnicalProfile
-> AIUsageFlow
-> ReconciliationConflict or VerifiedProfile
```

### Legal-to-Document Orchestration

```text
VerifiedProfile
-> Hybrid Retrieval / LegalRuleMatch
-> RiskClassification
-> GapAnalysis
-> GeneratedDocument
```

Every async state shows loading, timeout, failed, blocked, retry/re-run, and audit-reference behavior in UX.

## Internal Legal Operations Flow

The following is required system functionality but excluded from Manager UX scope:

```text
approved source URL
-> ingest snapshot
-> hash and normalize
-> internal legal review
-> approve immutable LegalCorpusVersion
-> build ChromaDB vectorless legal index
-> expose approved version to retrieval
```

The MVP interface for this actor is internal API/CLI and operational audit records. A customer-facing corpus administration console is Post-MVP.

## UX Deliverable Boundary

`bmad-ux` must produce canonical Manager experiences for active flows, including responsive layouts, accessibility, empty/loading/error/blocked/degraded states, automatic trigger mapping states, status language, evidence/citation disclosure, and safe recovery actions. It must not create active screens for Developer invitations/tasks, manual scanner report upload, `FR-051`, `FR-052`, structured attestation, or customer-facing corpus administration.
