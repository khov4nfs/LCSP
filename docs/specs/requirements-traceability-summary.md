# LCSP Requirements Traceability Summary

## Purpose

Summarize canonical requirement and planning traceability after Phase 5.2L active-document correction and readiness remediation. This document supports sprint planning review but does not authorize implementation by itself.

## Canonical Inventory

| Story traceability       | created / assessable via `docs/test-artifacts/traceability/implementation-readiness-traceability-2026-06-25.md`                                |

`NFR-031` and `NFR-032` are legacy aliases of active `NFR-005` and `NFR-008`. PRD `FR-E*` values and legacy `UC-MXX-XX` values are source aliases only.

## Active Scope

- RBAC is the authorization source of truth; roles are attributes/templates only.
- GitHub App read-only Repository Scan is the golden technical-evidence path.
- `FR-050` automatically creates or resumes scan workflows from trusted integration context.
- Python Worker Platform owns all asynchronous domain workloads.
- Repository analysis uses native Deep Agents with LCSP Docker sandbox tools and optional Codebase Memory MCP; direct repository source is the evidence authority.
- Real LLM provider configuration is required for A-to-Z acceptance; dense embedding providers are not required for legal retrieval MVP.
- Legal corpus uses validated official-source snapshots, internal approval, immutable versioning, and ChromaDB structure-first vectorless retrieval with legal hierarchy, xref expansion and citation allowlist validation.
- Manager can complete the golden path without external collaborator participation.
- Structured attestation is `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`.
- Local/CI scanner report upload is superseded by `FR-050`.
- Manual evidence JSON (`FR-051`) is `REMOVED_FROM_PRODUCT`.
- Delegated free-form clarification (`FR-052`) is Deferred/Post-MVP.

## UX Boundary

UX must be rebased or regenerated from the pruned active authority set. The next UX artifact must cover:

- Manager authentication, organization, assessment, Wizard, repository, scan, evidence, reconciliation, classification, gap, document, and audit experiences;
- Developer invitation/task experiences are retired; evidence views remain redacted without structured attestation;
- all loading, empty, permission-denied, insufficient, blocked, failed, retry, rerun, degraded, and audit-reference states.

It must not design active customer-facing flows for:

- manual scanner report upload, `FR-051`, `FR-052`, and structured attestation;
- corpus source ingestion, review, approval, or index administration;
- production administration outside active MVP scope.

Internal Legal Operator corpus administration remains API/CLI-only for MVP. Manager UX may display assessment-relevant corpus version and citation provenance only.

## Story Dependency Carry-Forward

| FR     | Required story-layer NFR dependencies |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| FR-053 | NFR-017, NFR-034                      |
| FR-054 | NFR-017, NFR-034                      |
| FR-055 | NFR-012, NFR-033                      |
| FR-056 | NFR-017, NFR-033, NFR-034             |

Every story must trace to canonical UC, FR, AC, relevant NFRs, UX flow/state, domain state, implementation area, and failure/recovery behavior.
