# LCSP Domain State Machines

> **Historical pre-freeze documentation.** This document records the earlier design or implementation. Current architecture authority is [the canonical Architecture Freeze](../../reports/architecture-freeze-migration-manifest.md); current runtime names and release status must be read there and in the current PR #367 receipts.

## Purpose

Canonical state transitions for the A-to-Z runnable MVP. Physical enums remain owned by `persistence-implementation.md`.

## Common Rules

- Every transition requires a guard and material state changes write AuditEvent.
- Async work uses names from `event-catalog.md`.
- Completed and failed artifacts are immutable history.
- Classification requires direct EngineeringRule evaluation with legal-rule provenance and evidence refs.
- Final document requires classification, GapAnalysis, citations, and no unresolved conflict.
- Manager completion never depends on external collaborator participation.
- RBAC is the authorization source of truth for all user and service transitions.
- Structured attestation is `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP` and has no active state machine.

## RepositoryScanJob

States: `REQUESTED`, `RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELED`.

- Request creates REQUESTED only when snapshot and unique idempotency key exist.
- Python Worker consumption moves REQUESTED to RUNNING.
- COMPLETED requires accepted report and verified workspace cleanup.
- Any terminal scan failure moves REQUESTED/RUNNING to FAILED.
- Rerun creates a new job; COMPLETED or FAILED never returns to RUNNING.

## TrustedScanTrigger and ScanMappingResolution

Trigger states: `RECEIVED`, `CONTEXT_VALIDATING`, `READY_TO_SNAPSHOT`, `PENDING_MAPPING`, `BLOCKED_MAPPING`, `WAITING_FOR_CONTEXT`, `REJECTED`.

```text
RECEIVED
-> CONTEXT_VALIDATING
-> READY_TO_SNAPSHOT
or PENDING_MAPPING
or BLOCKED_MAPPING
or WAITING_FOR_CONTEXT
or REJECTED
```

- Invalid signature or untrusted source moves to REJECTED and creates no scan.
- RBAC denial moves to REJECTED and is audited.
- Missing mapping moves to PENDING_MAPPING or WAITING_FOR_CONTEXT.
- Ambiguous mapping moves to BLOCKED_MAPPING.
- READY_TO_SNAPSHOT may create immutable RepositorySnapshot and RepositoryScanJob.
- Duplicate delivery is idempotent and must not duplicate artifacts.
- Idempotency key, retry/DLQ and replay behavior are governed by `docs/implementation/decisions/trusted-scan-trigger-retry-dlq-replay-decision.md`.

## TechnicalEvidenceReport

```text
DRAFT -> SCHEMA_VALID -> QUALITY_VALID
                    -> QUALITY_INSUFFICIENT
DRAFT or SCHEMA_VALID -> FAILED
```

Only QUALITY_VALID linked to a COMPLETED ScanJob with verified cleanup is downstream eligible.

## TechnicalProfile

Derived states: `NOT_CREATED`, `READY`, `BLOCKED`, `STALE`.

Accepted report creates READY. Invalid or insufficient evidence creates BLOCKED. New accepted evidence leaves the prior immutable profile projected as STALE.

## AIUsageFlow

States: `DRAFT`, `READY`, `UNCLEAR`, `CONFLICTED`, `BLOCKED`.

- READY requires evidence refs on material claims and no critical unknown or conflict.
- UNCLEAR preserves unsupported critical facts.
- CONFLICTED records declaration/evidence mismatch.
- BLOCKED records failed required input or gate.
- Provider-only evidence cannot create READY confirmed usage.

## ReconciliationConflict and VerifiedProfile

Conflict states: `CONFLICT_OPEN`, `RESOLVED`, `VERIFIED`.

```text
CONFLICT_OPEN
-> Manager resolution with rationale
-> RESOLVED
-> reconciliation confirms
-> VERIFIED
```

VerifiedProfile states: `NOT_CREATED`, `READY`, `STALE`. Open conflict prevents creation. New upstream evidence leaves the prior immutable version STALE.

Structured Developer attestation is `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP` and cannot transition Conflict, VerifiedProfile, or Classification.

## Retired Developer Task and Removed Attestation

Developer task states are historical only: `INVITED`, `ACTIVE`, `REVOKED`, `EXPIRED`, `COMPLETED`.

Attestation states are historical only: `SUBMITTED`, `ACCEPTED_AS_SUPPLEMENTAL`, `REJECTED`, `WITHDRAWN`.

`FR-010`, `FR-011`, `FR-047`, `FR-045/FR-046` structured attestation and `FR-052` delegated free-form clarification have no active MVP state machine.

## Legal Source Ingestion

States: `REQUESTED`, `FETCHING`, `SNAPSHOTTED`, `NORMALIZED`, `STAGED`, `FAILED`.

```text
validated source
-> command.legal-source.ingest.requested.v1
-> FETCHING
-> SNAPSHOTTED
-> NORMALIZED
-> STAGED in a DRAFT corpus
```

Validation, redirect, snapshot, identity, or normalization failure produces FAILED and no retrievable corpus item.

## LegalCorpusVersion

States: `DRAFT`, `APPROVED`, `SUPERSEDED`.

- DRAFT becomes APPROVED only after Internal Legal Operator review.
- APPROVED content is immutable.
- A newer approved version may mark an older version SUPERSEDED.
- Existing assessments retain their pinned version.
- Rejected review remains unavailable and is recorded separately.

## Corpus Index Build

States: `NOT_REQUESTED`, `REQUESTED`, `RUNNING`, `READY`, `FAILED`.

```text
LegalCorpusVersion APPROVED
-> command.legal-index-build.requested.v1
-> REQUESTED -> RUNNING
-> event.legal-index-build.completed.v1 -> READY
or event.legal-index-build.failed.v1 -> FAILED
```

Only READY ChromaDB legal indexes are available to vectorless legal retrieval.

## Legal Matching

Status: `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`.

The retired legal matching state machine is not an active gate for new assessment execution. Direct EngineeringRule assessment owns legal-rule provenance and citation-backed evaluation.

## RiskClassification

States: `REQUESTED`, `RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `BLOCKED`, `FAILED`.

COMPLETED requires direct EngineeringRule evaluations, citation basis, evidence refs, and valid guarded model output where used. Missing prerequisites, evidence-less claims, or unsupported conclusion yields BLOCKED.

## GapAnalysis

States: `REQUESTED`, `RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `BLOCKED`, `FAILED`.

COMPLETED requires usable classification and legal basis. BLOCKED or FAILED prevents final document generation.

## GeneratedDocument

States: `REQUESTED`, `RUNNING`, `GENERATED`, `BLOCKED`, `FAILED`.

Final report requires classification, GapAnalysis, citations, and no conflict. Readiness-only output may exist earlier without a risk level. Artifact publication requires storage reference, hash, and output guard approval.

## Audit Export

States: `REQUESTED`, `GENERATED`, `FAILED`.

Export contains redacted event and version references only.
