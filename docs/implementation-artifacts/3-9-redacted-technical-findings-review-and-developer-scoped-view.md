# Story 3.9: Redacted Technical Findings Review and Developer Scoped View

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a Manager or scoped Developer, I want to review redacted technical findings, confidence, evidence refs, and coverage limitations, so that I can understand evidence without exposing raw source, secrets, prompts, or out-of-scope data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** accepted technical evidence exists
   **When** Manager opens technical findings
   **Then** LCSP shows redacted finding summaries, finding type, affected component reference, evidence references, confidence, coverage limitations, and scan version
   **And** it does not expose raw source, secrets, full prompts, or full AST dumps.

2. **Given** a Developer has a scoped task assignment
   **When** the Developer opens technical findings
   **Then** LCSP shows only assigned or permitted finding surfaces
   **And** hides Manager-only controls and out-of-scope assessment data
   **And** all access is RBAC-evaluated and audited.

3. **Given** a Developer has assigned repository or findings tasks
   **When** the Developer opens the workspace
   **Then** LCSP shows assigned task list, due or expiry state, permitted actions, task completion action, and handback status to the Manager
   **And** the Manager workspace shows that Developer participation is optional and no Developer assignment is required to continue the Manager golden path.

4. **Given** Developer scope is revoked or expires while a task is open
   **When** the Developer attempts to continue, complete, download, or hand back the task
   **Then** LCSP denies the action server-side, refreshes the task state, hides out-of-scope data, and audits the denial.

5. **Given** an actor lacks permission for a finding or assessment
   **When** the actor requests technical evidence
   **Then** LCSP denies access server-side
   **And** returns a safe explanation without leaking whether hidden evidence exists.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

- Packet type: `planning-derived-developer-packet`
- Story key: `3-9-redacted-technical-findings-review-and-developer-scoped-view`
- Official execution artifact: `docs/implementation-artifacts/3-9-redacted-technical-findings-review-and-developer-scoped-view.md`
- Epic: `Epic 3 - Trusted Repository Evidence and TechnicalProfile`
- Runtime ownership: `apps/api`, `deepagents`, `packages/*`

### Current State and Scope Guardrails

- Epic 3 là bridge từ assessment sang trusted technical evidence. Đây là boundary dễ phá privacy nhất nếu implementation lỏng tay.
- Story trong epic này phải giữ repository analysis trong LCSP Agent Runtime ở ngoài web request lifecycle; API chỉ orchestration/status và không chạy repository analysis inline.
- Handoff chính của epic là `RepositorySnapshot`, `TechnicalEvidenceReport`, rồi `TechnicalProfile`; ba artifact này phải giữ boundary rõ.

- Previous story context: `docs/developer/story-handbook/3-8-technicalprofile-generation.md`
- Next story dependency seam: `docs/developer/story-handbook/3-10-scan-re-run-without-mutating-history.md`
- Artifact chain for this epic: repository connection -> commit-pinned snapshot -> trusted scan trigger -> LCSP Agent Runtime repository analysis -> TechnicalEvidenceReport -> TechnicalProfile.
- Workflow/state focus: repository/snapshot/scan/evidence/profile states from REPOSITORY_CONNECTED to TECHNICAL_PROFILE_READY.

### Story-Specific Implementation Tasks

- Build review surface for technical findings with redacted evidence context and scoped access rules.
- Separate Manager/business-safe views from Developer technical scope where required by RBAC.
- Audit findings access and prevent exposure of raw source, secrets or out-of-scope data.

### Task to Acceptance Criteria Traceability

- `AC1`: Build review surface for technical findings with redacted evidence context and scoped access rules.
- `AC2`: Separate Manager/business-safe views from Developer technical scope where required by RBAC.
- `AC3`: Audit findings access and prevent exposure of raw source, secrets or out-of-scope data.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Story 3.8 TechnicalProfile and accepted evidence.
- RBAC scoped Developer collaboration from Epic 1.

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No exposure of raw source/full prompts/secrets.
- No Manager-only business declarations in Developer-scoped view.
- No final AIUsageFlow or legal interpretation in findings review.

### Story-Specific Risks and Edge Cases

- Overexposure of technical evidence.
- Developer sees Manager-only declarations/actions.
- Redaction strips provenance too aggressively for review usefulness.

### Architecture Compliance

- NestJS API chỉ tạo trusted trigger, persist status và enqueue command qua outbox; Python Worker Platform sở hữu scan/tool execution và downstream profile work.
- LCSP Agent Runtime repository analysis phải dùng restricted workspace, pinned tools, bounded resources và cleanup verification trước completed event.
- TechnicalProfile là artifact kỹ thuật bất biến; không được dùng như AIUsageFlow, VerifiedProfile hay compliance status.

### Functional and Domain Requirements

- Story này phải được triển khai đúng theo acceptance criteria của riêng nó; không kéo behavior của story sau vào cùng slice nếu không có seam thật sự cần thiết.
- Domain chain liên quan của Epic 3: repository connection -> commit-pinned snapshot -> trusted scan trigger -> LCSP Agent Runtime repository analysis -> TechnicalEvidenceReport -> TechnicalProfile.
- Khi story chạm workflow gate, blocked/degraded path là một phần của yêu cầu chứ không phải edge-case tuỳ chọn.


### Data and Persistence Requirements

- Các story Epic 3 thường chạm `RepositoryConnection`, `RepositorySnapshot`, `ScanJob`, `TechnicalEvidenceReport`, `TechnicalProfile`, outbox event và audit metadata.
- Raw source không được thành persistent store thông thường; snapshot/workspace là ephemeral hoặc tightly-controlled artifact boundary.
- Tool provenance, config/ruleset hash, severity policy và evidence refs là dữ liệu bắt buộc cho downstream trust.

### State and Audit Requirements

- State authority trọng tâm gồm `REPOSITORY_CONNECTED`, `TRUSTED_SCAN_TRIGGERED`, `SNAPSHOT_CREATED`, `SCAN_REQUESTED`, `SCAN_RUNNING`, `SCAN_COMPLETED`, `TECHNICAL_EVIDENCE_READY`, `TECHNICAL_PROFILE_READY`.
- Cleanup/privacy/provenance failure phải block chain và không cho TechnicalProfile downstream.
- Rerun phải tạo immutable chain mới thay vì mutate scan/evidence/profile lịch sử.

### File Structure Notes

- `apps/api` cho repository selection, scan request/status API và outbox command creation.
- `deepagents` cho queue consumer, repository-analysis runtime, evidence gates, TechnicalProfile worker.
- `packages/*` cho command/event schemas, status projection contracts, evidence/profile DTOs.

### Implementation Guidance for the Dev Agent

- Không reintroduce manual upload path hoặc Local/CI report upload; trusted scan là golden path duy nhất.
- Command/event naming, idempotency key và retry/DLQ behavior phải bám authority docs thay vì tự phát minh.
- Khi evidence chưa đủ hoặc provenance/privacy fail, hãy block/degrade rõ ràng thay vì overclaim “scan completed”.

### Testing Requirements

- API/worker contract tests cho trusted trigger, outbox enqueue và status projection.
- Scanner sandbox/cleanup security tests, provenance/severity policy assertions.
- TechnicalEvidenceReport gate coverage và immutable TechnicalProfile versioning tests.
